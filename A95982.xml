            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>I begin with the <hi>Paſſeover</hi> which was the ſecond (for Circumciſion was the firſt) ordinary ſtanding Sacrament of the Jewiſh Church, beginning at their going forth out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and continuing till the Death of Chriſt, when the Lords Supper did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence or begin, and ſo diſplaced it; The <hi>Paſſeover,</hi> ſignified what ſhould be the Lords Supper, what is fulfilled in Chriſt; In the <hi>Paſſeover,</hi> were repreſented the Sufferings and Death of Chriſt by a Lamb ſlain roſted with fire; In the Supper, by bread broken, and wine poured forth.

The Apoſtle had ſown good corn in this field by his Doctrine. I have delivered unto you the naked inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Chriſt, and now it ſtands in need of weed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

He raiſed up <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> and after him a fry of <hi>Gnosticks,</hi> or knowing people, ſo they would be called, but falſly, ſaith <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> to corrupt the Doctrine; and it was betimes that the Devil ſet his foot in this moſt excellent Ordinance, and from firſt to laſt there have been ſcarce any times wherein ſome ſoil hath not cleaved to this Sacrament, every Age adding or declaring ſomewhat, till it became a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, unlike it ſelf in the Romiſh Maſſe, which is a Maſſe of Idolatry and abomination, a very abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of deſolation to this Ordinance, the ſtamp of Chriſts inſtitution being ſo defaced, that he that minted it cannot own his own coyn; for being an
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:115895:24"/> outward Ordinance, conſiſting of outward elements and actions, the fancy of men thinks, this and that dreſſing would do better, and ſo by putting on more ornaments, as they call them, they quite ſpoil the feature of the childe; and if men would be tamper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing while the Apoſtles lived, what would they do after? If I ſhould ſay, that the unhappieſt and old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt weeds have grown in this Garden, I ſhould not ſpeak far wide; I may ſay of it, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith of man, <hi>Eccleſ. 7. 29.

He brought forth to him bread and wine.</hi> Chriſt did not take theſe two by accident, becaUſe he found them then on the Table, but by choice and election for their Uſe in ſignifying. The old Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had a Table-Sacrament, the Paſſeover, and Chriſt will have the Goſpel-Church to have a Table-Sacrament too, this Supper; but as before Chriſt their Sacrifices and Sacraments were all bloudy: So when Chriſt the ſubſtance of all Sacrifices and Sacraments hath ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd, the Sacraments of the Goſpel and Sacrifices are unbloudy: Many Divines ſhew the conveniency

The participation of his Body and Blood for ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrength, and ſoul-refreſhment, could not be better ſhadowed forth than by the ſtaff of Bread; and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Wine; which as they are the moſt common<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo the moſt neceſſary and prime materials that are Uſed at our tables, anſwering both our appetites of hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and thirſt; weakneſs is ſtrengthened by bread, faintneſs cheriſht by wine, the faint and feeble ſoul by Chriſt. Famine and thirſt are importunate things, no delights of the eye, no Muſick to the ear can ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them. Violent deſires towards Chriſt are not to be excUſed, but praiſed: For his <hi>Fleſh is meat indeed, his Blood is drink indeed,</hi> Joh. 6. 55.</p>

The Papiſts, as to their Prieſts and ſome Kings or Princes, will allow bread and wine, but as to the common people, bread or wine they ſay by concomitancy, the blood is in the bread virtually, and ſo they ſhut up the wounds of Chriſt by their dry Maſs. But Chriſt would repreſent himſelf here not as a Lamb, but a Lamb ſacrificed and ſlain; and therefore the blood is ſevered from the body, as the money is not a priſoners ranſom, while it lies in the cheſt, but when it's paid: So the blood of Chriſt as ſhed is our ranſom. As <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs had a type of Chriſt, Manna which they did eat, and the rock alſo of which they drank, ſo have we the memorials of his body and blood, that we may eat and drink.</p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:115895:46"/>
                  <p>And which is the ſumme of all that may be ſaid on this point, ſince the Lord was pleaſed even under the Goſpel to continue that old way of Fellowſhip and Communion with his Church, by entertaining them at his own Table, upon his own chear in an Ordinance of eating and drinking; as he alwaies al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to feaſt with him upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders of the Sacrifices in token of followſhip: and the very Heathens did by feaſting on their Sacrifices teſtifie their fellowſhip with their Idols, as is plain, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 18, 19, 20. I ſee not how more fit materials could be Uſed then Bread and Wine, which as they beſt ſtand with the ſimplicity of the Goſpel, ſo they are the moſt common and neceſſary atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants in all feaſts, and do both together ſet forth that full and perfect nouriſhment which we finde in Chriſt.</p>

We being many are one bread, and one body, for we are all partakers of that one bread.</hi> And this union of members was anciently profeſſed with all dearneſs of love and affection in the Uſe of this Ordinance; and they delighted to expreſs their diviſion and ſeparation from all the world, their combination and concorporation among themſelves, by all entercourſes of love and dearneſs that could

The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is a viſible Word, and therefore I hold it requiſite that the Communicant be within ſight of the Elements and Actions, that he may ſee the bread and the wine, Taken, Bleſſed, Broken, Poured forth; and not in corners and holes, whence he hath not the actions under command of his eye. Not that I deny but a blinde man may receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but that all means of ſpirituall impreſſion muſt be Uſed. <hi>Behold,</hi> ſaith <hi>Moſes, the blood of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> Exod. 24. 8.</p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:115895:47"/>
                  <p>The firſt Action of Chriſt is, <hi>He took bread, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife after ſupper, the cup,</hi> ſo <hi>Paul,</hi> ſo <hi>Luke. He took the bread, he took the cup,</hi> ſo <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Mark:</hi> of the two Elements the Bread is firſt taken both by Chriſt, and by the Communicant: This order is to be held by the conſent of all the four Writers; And of Chriſts Action, let us Note</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That Chriſt took the Bread into his hands, he took the Cup into his hands, Obſerving the rite and cuſtom then Uſed, and gave thanks over the Bread, holding it in his hands, and ſo over the Cup, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it in his hands: This is the firſt ſtep towards the ſeparating and ſetting apart the Elements; he took them in his hand, ſee there was a ſolemn rite that the <hi>pater familias</hi> did Uſe to take into his hands and bleſs theſe principall parts of the meal or feaſt. The taking of the Lamb was the firſt action towards the Paſchall, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 2, 5, 21.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That Chriſt took and bleſt the Bread and the Cup ſeverally, one after the other: He took Bread and bleſt, and pronounced, <hi>This is my Body.</hi> After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he took the Cup and bleſt, and pronounced, <hi>This Cup is the New Teſtament in my Blood:</hi> The E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi> expreſs it, <hi>Luke</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> likewiſe confirm it; and if there were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, the very rule and uſage amongſt the Jewes to bleſſe them ſeverally, would prove it to us.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But whether there was any intervall of time between his taking and bleſſing the Bread and the Wine, is a harder knot: <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi> ſay, <hi>As they were eating,</hi> or as they did eat, <hi>he took Bread: Luke</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> ſay, <hi>After they had ſupped he took the

                  <p>For the firſt, Whether Chriſt did with his own hand deliver the bread and cup into the hand of every particular Communicant, <hi>viz.</hi> immediately? We muſt look ſtill to the rite or cuſtome Uſed in the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal Supper; and if we conſider that well, we ſhall ſee it probable, that the <hi>Pater-familias</hi> did not riſe from his diſcumbency or poſture of lying, to go to every particular perſon, or that every one came to his hand, for there might be twenty at the Table, and not all within the reach of his hand, nor do we finde that Chriſt roſe up, nor that they roſe up to receive them. He ſaid, <hi>Take ye, eat ye, Drink all of it;</hi> and though he might give the Cup to the next into his hand, yet his ſpeech is general to them all, and ſo the bread and the cup paſt in the <hi>Poſtcaenium,</hi> or Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal Supper. <hi>Maldonate</hi> ſaith, He reacht out the <note place="margin">Maldona<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

There might be different Rites in ſeverall Churches as to this point, and of no great moment one way or other; but for all the Communicants ſitting down at the very Table by companies, and their ſitting and receiving the Elements, I finde not in my ſimple reading in Antiquity, when Communicants grew numerous, and met in one common place to perform Divine Offices: but ſo did Chriſt and all other Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chall ſocieties, which eat in chambers and hoUſes, and as I ſhewed you before, were not under ten nor above twenty of a company.</p>

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:115895:55"/> be accounted indifferent too, and hardly and not conveniently imitable in our numbers, yea and not certain neither (though very probable to me) for if one, as <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> holds it ſo, yet another, as <note place="margin">Martyr. in <hi>1 Cor. 11. 24.</hi>

                  <p>Let us touch the other Queſtion, Whether there were any words ſpoken to every one at the deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into his hands; and here indeed we finde no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>Take ye, eat, this is my Body broken for you: Drink ye all of it, this is the Cup of the New Teſtament;</hi> and doubtleſs the whole Inſtitution needs not to every ſingle perſon be repeated, having been recited in the Conſecration: Yet you know that in the form Uſed in <hi>England,</hi> the Miniſter was appointed to deliver Bread and Wine into the Communicants particular hands, with a preſcript form of words, <hi>The Body of our Lord, The Blood of our Lord,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>Chemnitius</hi>

                  <p>The ſignification of it is, the appropriation of Chriſt to our ſelves, whom God makes ours by his gift, and we make ours by faith, even as truly as if he were put into our very hand.

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>11</label> 2. <hi>Eat ye, drink ye all of it:</hi> Chriſt ſpeaks and repeats often <hi>Joh. 6. the eating of his fleſh, and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his blood,</hi> at which ſome of his followers took offence, conceiving him carnally and literally, which he told them were to be underſtood ſpiritually, <hi>ver.</hi> 63. There is a ſpirituall eating and drinking Chriſt his fleſh and blood by faith only, which is <hi>extra</hi>-ſymbolicall or without the Sacrament, for that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine was delivered a year or two before this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was inſtituted; and it is ſuch, as without which <hi>ye have no life in you,</hi> ver. 53. which may not be ſaid of all that never received this Sacrament; but that ſpirituall eating and drinking is here ſymbolized, as that fleſh and blood is: For the underſtanding of which, let us neither be like the carnall <hi>Iſraelite</hi> that did eat Manna, and drink of the Rock, but neither ſaw nor taſted Chriſt in them; nor on the other ſide let us be like the <hi>Capernaites,</hi> Joh. 6. that had a groſs apprehenſion of eating very fleſh, and drinking mans blood, but rightly conceive the meaning thus:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The firſt and not the leaſt thing is this, that This is the one and only Ordinance under the Goſpel where eating and drinking are Sacred and Religious acts: for in all the world, among all ſorts of men, friendſhip, fellowſhip, communion, are maintained
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:115895:58"/> and ſhown in feaſting together, eating and drinking together; and our God never let his Church be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch an Ordinance, wherein he and his people might teſtifie this fellowſhip and communion: In the Law there was not only a Lamb roſted, but in all their <hi>Shelamim</hi> or Peace-offerings, they that brought them had part to feaſt upon and make good cheer as at all their feaſts they rejoyced before the Lord, God bidding them to his own Table to feed upon Sacrifices, for they that eat of the Sacrifices <hi>are partakers of the Altar,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 18. &amp; <hi>Rev. 3. 20. I will come in and ſup with him, and he with me:</hi> Thus God entertains his friends, invites them to eat and drink with him upon his own Sacrifices, upon Chriſt the great Sacrifice: It's Gods own cheer, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for ſuch <hi>Abrahams</hi> as are the friends of God: What a favour and condeſcenſion of God is this! What honour and dignity is duſt and ſhes graced with, to ſit together and feaſt and have fellowſhip with God in an Ordinance of eating and drinking the fleſh and blood of this Sacrifice Jeſus Chriſt! Nay, and further yet, It was a cuſtom in Covenants making that the Confederates feaſted, eat and drank together; therefore <hi>Berith</hi> the Hebrew word Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, may come of <hi>Barah</hi> to eat, and ſo ſtill, and further it is implied that this is a Covenant ſolemnity, an eating and drinking of confederates together, God ſmels a ſavour of reſt in the Sacrifice of Chriſt, and we eat and drink of that fleſh and blood ſacrificed unto God, and renew our Covenant with him, and he with us, by mutuall feeling, he to be ours, we his. I am ſo taken up with this, that if no more be ſaid, I ſhould be ſatisfied, but there is more.</p>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:115895:58"/>
                  <p>2. That Chriſt is full and perfect nouriſhment of the ſoul, both meat and drink; <hi>Joh. 6. 55. My fleſh is meat indeed, my blood is drink indeed,</hi> farre beyond Manna, which yet was called <hi>Angels food,</hi> as the ſubſtance is beyond the type: ſights may pleaſe the eye, ſounds or airs the ear, but they are not ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary as nouriſhment unto life; life cannot be maintained without nouriſhment; growing bodies <gap reason="foreign">

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the ſtature of a full Chriſt: de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caying Chriſtians ſtand in need of nouriſhment to repair decaies: Every life, be it never ſo little muſt be nouriſht, ſo neceſſary is Chriſt to every Chriſtian, and ſtill more of Chriſt, for his meat is Chriſt, his drink is Chriſt. As nothing ſo neceſſary, ſo neither ſo ſweet and pleaſant, ſights are pleaſing to the eye, and ſmels to the ſenſe, but nothing is ſo cloſe and delightfull as the meat and drink to the ſenſe of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting; Chriſt is ſweet to faith, as meat and drink to hunger: There is no content comparable to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of Chriſt. He is Manna, the beſt Bread and Wine, the beſt drink. The fruition of the joys of heaven is ſet forth by the pleaſure of eating and drinking, <hi>Luk. 22. 30. That you may eat and drink at my Table in my Kingdome.</hi> It was experimentally ſaid of <hi>Galeacius</hi> that all the delights of this world are not comparable to an hours enjoyment of Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>2. No act of ours could ſo well have ſignified the cloſe and intimate union of Chriſt with a Beleever: We may ſee at a diſtance, and hear and ſmell, but not taſte nor eat nor drink; the meat and drink is
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:115895:59"/> concorporated into us, and is made fleſh and bone with us, <hi>Job. 6. 56. He that eateth my fleſh and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth my blood, dwels in me, and I in him:</hi> Chriſt muſt be preſent to the faith of a Chriſtian, for we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eat and drink that which is abſent. This union with Chriſt is reall, though myſticall, and it is live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drawn forth in this Ordinance, under the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of eating and drinking: We hardly conceive, and hardly beleeve it, but when we ſee the graft live, we are ſure it's knit; and we may be as ſure of our union with Chriſt, by his ſpirituall ſap of Grace which we finde is in us.</p>
                  <p>4. This command, <hi>Take and eat,</hi> goes before the pronouncing of the words, <hi>This is my Body; Aquinas</hi> ſaith it is a <hi>Hyſteron Proteron,</hi> but I ſhall not take his word, let's hear him ſpeak that was preſent, an ear witneſs, an eye witneſs <hi>Matth. 26. 26, 27. Take eat, This is my Body; Drink ye all of it, For this is my Blood:</hi> what ſtands this <hi>For</hi> for, if <hi>drink ye,</hi> did not go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? This Obſervation is noted by almoſt all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines from <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Hooker</hi> makes Uſe of it thus, That Chriſt is not preſent in the Elements, but in the worthy receiver: The order of the words ſhews it, firſt <hi>eat and drink,</hi> then it follows, <hi>for this is my Body, and this is my Blood:</hi> an ingenious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation that cuts the hamſtrings of the Popiſh or corporall preſence in or under the outward ſignes, as if it were a knife ſet in the Text to cut that intricate knot, that makes ſuch a garboyle in the Text: when you take and eat by faith, then is the Body and Blood of Chriſt preſent to you, but not latent and hidden in the Bread or Cup: The union of Chriſt is not otherwiſe with the Bread then as the thing ſignified
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:115895:59"/> with the ſign, but it is with the Communicant, the <note place="margin">

                  <p>Firſt, Chriſt gave bread to his Diſciples at this Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; for that which he took, which he bleſt, which he brake, was bread, <hi>He took bread,</hi> and that he gave, ſaying, <hi>This is my body which is broken for you;</hi> for the bread was broken as a ſigne that his body ſhould be crucified, and bread the Apoſtle cals it after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration, thrice in this Chapter, <hi>verſ.</hi> 26, 27, 28. and 1 <hi>Cor. 10. 16.

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>2</label> The Churches of our Confeſſion have warily and juſtly avoided the extreams on both ſides.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The firſt extream is that which ſome did fear in <hi>Zuinglius</hi> and others at firſt, and yet is unjuſtly charged upon us by many, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, naked ſignes, empty figures and ſhadows, meerly repreſenting the death of Chriſt, as the Picture of <hi>Hercules</hi> reſembles and repreſents <hi>Hercules,</hi> which we diſclaim, and leave it to Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anizing ſpirits, and other Levellers of Divinity; for we are taught that Sacramentall ſignes are more than meer repreſenting ſignes, being Seals which do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm and make over unto us the ſpirituall benefit which they repreſent and exhibit, alſo they are ſigns which God commands us to Uſe, and in their right Uſe he conferres upon us the benefit, as the Seal
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:115895:71"/> paſſes a Right to the Eſtate promiſed and conveyed, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom. 4. 11. He received the ſign of circumciſion, a ſeal of the righteouſneſs of faith,</hi> and 1 <hi>Cor. 10. 16. The cup of bleſsing which we bleſs, is it not the communion of the blood of Chriſt; The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Chriſt?</hi> not repreſentation only, but communion or participation alſo; for the picture of a loaf of bread feeds not the hungry, nor doth the Ivy-buſh refreſh the weary, and therefore there is not only a repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of the body of Chriſt broken, by the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the bread, but <hi>Take and eat and drink,</hi> which denotes participation of the body and blood of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The other extream is twofold: 1. That the very body and blood of Chriſt is, as it were, moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded up with the bread and wine, or hidden under them, which is the ſenſe of the Conſubſtantiatiſts or Lutheran Churches; and this, though it be too groſs an opinion, yet is not liable to ſo many mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and incompreſenſible abſurdities as the other, which is, 2. That the bread and wine ceaſe to be, and are evoided, being turned or change, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of them into the very ſubſtance of the fleſh and blood of Chriſt, which is hidden under the <hi>ſpecies</hi> or outward accidents of bread and wine, a monſtrous Paradox, holden ſtifly by the Tranſubſtantiatiſts or Papiſts.</p>
                  <p>The middle way holden by the Churches of our Confeſſion, is, That the outward Elements do repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent as Signes and exhibit as Seales and morall In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments to the faith of the receiver, the very Body and Blood of Chriſt ſacrificed, as ſpirituall repaſt
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:115895:71"/> for our ſouls and ſpiritually given and taken, but that they continue not as incorporated with them, nor are converted into the very naturall Body of Chriſt, as locally or corporally, there to be received by the mouth of the receiver.</p>
                  <p>We hold a difference or change of bread and wine bleſſed, but it is a change of ſignification not of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, a relative change, not reall, a change in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of Uſe and eſteem, not of their naturall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, as the wax, now a Seal to a Conveyance is wax ſtill, but not a Seal, not of that value till now; all the Rhetoricall flowers Uſed by the Ancients reach no further, if they do, we cannot keep them company: We hold that the Body and Blood of Chriſt is really, that is, truly exhibited and preſent to the faith of the receiver; and we might expreſs the reall preſence, as reall is oppoſed to imaginary or chimericall, were it not for caption and miſ-under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; none of ours denies the Body of Chriſt to be really, though ſpiritually eaten by a Beleever; nay it is <hi>immotum axioma,</hi> whatſoever is eaten, in that it is <note place="margin">

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:115895:72"/> the Lutheran ſenſe, no more than to ſay, This Cloak is <hi>Peter,</hi> becaUſe <hi>Peter</hi> is in it: nor in the Popiſh ſenſe, except the Body of Chriſt be there before the words be pronounced, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> which ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be thus, Let this be my Body; as God ſaid, <hi>Let there be light,</hi> not This is light, for it was not light before.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The ſpirituall benefit which is eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſts Body and Blood by faith, is no leſs in our ſenſe, than if there were his very fleſh, for Chriſt ſaith, <hi>The fleſh profits nothing,</hi> Joh. 6. and the Papiſts hold that the eating of Chriſts fleſh by wicked men profits nothing, except beſides the Sacramentall, there be a ſpirituall feeding upon Chriſt, which we affirm.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The Apoſtles underſtood theſe words as we do, and as the Hebrews had ever underſtood the ſame expreſſion for form in the Old Teſtament, elſe they would have been amazed and ſtartled at it, and have asked ſome Queſtion as they were inquifitive enough in leſſer matters, but they ſaw Chriſt fit at table, and eat and drink firſt himſelf, and therefore could not be ignorant of their meaning.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The Capernaite Diſciples, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. having taken offence at thoſe frequent expreſſions of eating Chriſts fleſh and drinking his blood, underſtanding them carnally, were anſwered by Chriſt himſelf, <hi>The fleſh profits nothing, The words that I ſpeak are ſpirit and life,</hi> as if he himſelf would give the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. The Apoſtle thrice in this Chapter following cals it ſtill bread after conſecration, as alſo in the Chapter foregoing, and ſurely he that never before
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:115895:73"/> did, would not delude the ſenſes of his Diſciples in this Ordinance; and himſelf cals it wine too, <hi>Matth. 26. 26. I will not henceforth drink of this fruit of the Vine,</hi> which is the Periphraſis uſuall among the Jews for wine.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. The remembrance of Chriſt, the <hi>ſhewing forth his death till he come,</hi> do import the abſence of his Body, which the Scripture tels us, aſcended into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and there is contained, in lieu of his corporall abſence he ſent the Spirit to abide for ever as another Comforter: Memorials and monuments are of things abſent.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. For the Ancient Fathers they prove againſt the Marcionites, that held the Body of Chriſt to be meerly phantaſticall, That it is ſubſtantiall, becaUſe the Elements of bread and wine are ſubſtantiall, which was no good argument, if only the accidents or ſhadows of the Elements do remain; and all along downwards they call the outward Elements, ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols, <note place="margin">

To reject with utmoſt deteſtation the impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and incomprehenſible Errour of Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and corporall preſence, by which Doctrine a ſilly Prieſt doth that which all the Angels cannot do, and that is, Make his Maker, as they call the Hoſt; and people do devour their God, and yet they juſtifie it by Gods omnipotency, that God is able to effect it, which is no better an argument than the Turks may juſtifie moſt of the fooleries of their Alcoran. There are two grounds for the rejection of this abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Idolatry and Sacriledge which doth enſue upon it, and that is the adoration and worſhip of the Hoſt, a piece of bread, and the mutilation or maim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Sacrament by bread only, and the propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatory Sacrifice of Chriſt himſelf in the Maſs, who was once only offered up to God upon the Croſs, all which are the iſſue of this Errour.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The monſters of contradiction and abſurdity to ſenſe and Reaſon which follow thereupon. It was begotten by feigned miracles and fabulous Legends, and is the mother of blaſphemies and inextricable abſurdities, which ſet faith it ſelf on the rack, and which though they would ſeem eaſily to blow away, yet by their ſtragling it appears they ſtrive with that they cannot maſter.

                  <p>But this of Tranſubſtantiation ſurpaſſes all, as I ſhew thus,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Suppoſe Chriſt ſitting at the table with his Diſciples, and eating this bread and drinking this cup firſt, as the cuſtom at the Paſchall Supper was, and as the Papiſts generally, and the Fathers hold, and we deny not, becaUſe the Scripture ſeems plain for it, <gap reason="foreign">

Henceforth I will not drink of the fruit of the Vine;</hi> ſuppoſing, I ſay, this, How is it poſſible or imaginable that he ſhould eat himſelf? or how can he ſit at table, and yet be in the mouths of his Apoſtles? Was he at the ſame time in his Apoſtles mouths or ſtomacks, while he ſate and roſe from table, and diſcourſed thoſe three Chapters of <hi>John</hi> 15, 16, 17? or while he ſweat that Bloody ſweat in his Agony in the Garden, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> a monſtrous im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility!</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It's Impoſſible to make that which was before exiſtent and in being: Can a father beget a ſon that <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Chelling.</hi> p. 70.</note> is already begotten? Can an Architect build a hoUſe that is already built? Can the body of Chriſt, which is before the converſion of the bread, be made or produced by the turning of bread into it? Can he that was conceived by the holy Ghoſt born of the Virgin be made by pronouncing of four or five words? If ever deluſions were ſtrong, theſe are, <hi>Nam factum facere &amp; factum infectum facere,</hi> are equally impoſſible.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They ſay that the ſubſtance of bread and wine is avoided, and that only the accidents remain, ſo that there is length and nothing long, breadth and nothing broad, thickneſs and nothing thick, white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:115895:74"/> and nothing white, moiſture and nothing moiſt, ſweetneſs and nothing ſweet, that is, a long, broad, thick, white, moiſt, ſweet Nothing. The Prieſt pours out nothing but lines and colours, when he pours out the wine, for theſe accidents of bread and wine are not in the bread, becaUſe that is avoided and vaniſht, and they are not in the Body of Chriſt, as themſelves ſay, and yet it is plain this bread and wine do nouriſh the body, and is the body nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by meer accidents? Can there be plainer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Can the ſame body at the ſame time have his juſt dimenſions, diſtance of parts, ſymmetry, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, as the Body of Chriſt hath, and yet not have theſe, becaUſe all parts? yea the whole Body of Chriſt, ſay they, are in one and the ſelf ſame point or crum of bread.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Can the Body of Chriſt which is much great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er be wholly contained in a wafer or piece of bread, in his full dimenſions, and that as many times as there are points, crums, drops in the bread or wine?</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Can the bread be turned into the very Body of Chriſt, and yet not anything of that bread become anything of Chriſt, nor the matter nor form nor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents of bread be made either the matter or form or accidents of Chriſt?</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Can the ſame thing, as Chriſts true Body, at the ſame time be wholly above it ſelf, and wholly below it ſelf, within and without it ſelf? can it be moved, and yet be ſtill? be carried from one place to another, and yet not move? be brought from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to earth, and yet not come out of heaven? who
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:115895:75"/> then can aſſure me that when he hung upon the Croſs, he was not walking ſomewhere elſe, crucified and not crucified, eaten and not eaten, alive in one, dead in another place, as in caſe the Apoſtles ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated this Supper while Chriſt was in the grave.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. What diſhonour do theſe men render the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt obnoxious unto, to be eaten by wicked men, by bruit creatures, by mice, by other vermin, to be caſt into ſome unclean place? for ſo long as the form of bread remains, ſo long the Body of Chriſt is there, though it be in the mouth or belly of a moUſe, ſaith <hi>Ales</hi> and the reſt of the Schoolmen, who do one where or other acknowledge the moſt of theſe monſtrous abſurdities, and go about to heal and ſalve them. I ſurceaſe from raking further into this ingratefull ſink, whoſe name Tranſubſtantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is but of yeſterday in compariſon, and which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honours the Body of Chriſt into a monſter, deſtroies the nature of the Sacrament, and fils the world with dreadfull contentions and broils; and let us but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, 1. What grievous impoſitions the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts lay upon the faith of them that are devoted to her communion. 2. What contradictions and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities the common people do ignorantly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly beleeve. 3. What ſtrong deluſions even to believe lies God gives up Learned men unto, that refUſe the ſimplicity of the truth for intereſts and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick ends! 4. What a mercy of God it is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver us from that tyranny, which leaves us no other choice, but to ſwallow and digeſt ſuch impoſſible things, or to be ſacrificed in flames; and the Lord forbid the re-entrance of that Religion among us,

Having paſt the moſt rugged and craggy part of my way, now we ſhall have a ſweeter and ſmoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way; and the third thing that I commend to you is, To keep fixt your eyes and hearts upon the inward of this Sacrament, which Chriſt himſelf doth anatomize and unfold to you, ſaying, <hi>This is my Body, This Cup is the New Teſtament in my Blood,</hi> teaching all Miniſters to explain the outward Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance what it means, and all communicants to ſet their hearts upon it; for as the Parchment and Wax are little worth, but the Eſtate conveyed, ſo the Bread and Wine do but convey by their Uſe, the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Blood of Chriſt, and the Covenant of grace and peace confirmed unto us; and as we Uſe to ſearch and pick out of every corner of the ſhell that's bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, as of a Wallnut, the kernell that is in it, ſo we ſhould ſtudy the marrow and kernell of this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, to loſe the ſight and Uſe of nothing here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented; God loſes honour and praiſe, and we bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and com ort, when we look not to the inwards of an outward Ordinance, eſpecially when Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and all the great and capitall benefits that accrue by him, are not only repreſented but confirmed, and to be participated: They that look upon a meer repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of Chriſts death in this Ordinance, reduce it to a pretence or ſhadow, and look for too little, for it's a ſealing Ordinance: They that look for his very Body to be eaten, look for too much; we may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from Gods inſtitutions the grace or benefit which God appoints them to exhibit, and in the way wherein he ſo appoints: Then have we the benefit of

The memoriall we celebrate, the benefit we participate here, and the great Queſtion, <hi>Whether I have remiſsion of ſins,</hi> whereat we ſtick, is here an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered to a doubting ſoul, that beleeves in deſire, not in comfort, as ſure as God can deviſe by outward Ordinance. The Word anſwers that Queſtion by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of qualification of the perſon, a Believer: The Spirit anſwers it by witneſſing and ſealing it up to our ſpirits that we are children: The graces of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation do anſwer it, as fruit doth to the life of the tree, by demonſtration: This Sacrament anſwers it by exhibition and offering Chriſt to me that I may appropriate him, for the blood was <hi>ſhed for you,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 20. for you that take and eat and drink.</p>

               <p>Theſe words contain our Saviour his mandate or charge for the celebration of this Ordinance, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the end whereunto it ſerves: <hi>This do in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of me: This do as oft as ye drink it in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of me.

                  <p>When I ſay it is a command given to the Church, or to the Saints, I mean, that it is an inner command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, an inner Ordinance, (as there was inner Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances in the Temple) for Church-members and Diſciples. The command of hearing the Word is given to all. The commandment of being baptized is to believers, as a Sacrament of their initiation or entrance, or admiſſion. To make a Diſciple, and to baptize one, ſeems to be put for the ſame, <hi>John</hi> 4. 1, 2. but this commandment, <hi>Do this,</hi> lies more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner yet, it appertains to them that are Diſciples alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or Church-members, which was ſignified in the ancient Chriſtian Churches by the baptiſtery or font at the Church-door, and by the Table <hi>intra Cancellos</hi> within the Chancel; ſo in the Paſſeover, a

Benefactours are honoured with ſolemn memorials; private remembrances which every man may agitate in his own minde are too low expreſſions of publick, and eminent, and univerſal benefits, therefore Chriſt will ſet up his own monument, and ordain a ſolemn Ordinance for remembrance of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to be Obſerved by all that have his memory, and it is one of the great Sea-marks of the Church of Chriſt, he did not ſet up anniverſaries or feſtivals for his Nativity, Circumciſion, Aſcenſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which the Churches in after times Obſerved, but he did ſet
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:115895:81"/> up in groſſe this ſolemn memorial of himſelf, and that is principally of his death; His death I ſay, <hi>For ye ſhew the Lords death,</hi> ver. 26. And why? BecaUſe his death is the expiation of ſinne, therein was made the Sacrifice of Atonement; Redemption, Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation was made thereby, the Covenant confirmed, the love of God to man demonſtrated, the juſtice of God for ſinne exemplified, the foundation of our righteouſneſſe, hope, peace and victory laid, the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of merit, the mirrour of mercy, the admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Angels, the center of all Chriſtianity, and the ſumme of all Scripture types, Prophecies, Promiſes, the moſt admirable of all the works of God that ever were; and indeed all that can be ſaid, and more then can be ſaid was here to be ſeen, and is here to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This remembrance of Chriſt muſt be lively and practical; There is a naked, hiſtorical, theoretical remembrance, a review of the <hi>Species</hi> or <hi>Ideas</hi> formerly imprinted in the minde; So <hi>Abſolom</hi> is remembred in his Pillar, and <hi>Lot</hi>'s wife in her pillar of ſalt, meerly hiſtorically; and there is a practical remembrance, which connotes affections fruitfull effect, and ſo in common ſpeech to remember is to requite good or evil, and in Scripture phraſe, God remembers our ſins, our ſervices, when he puniſhes or rewards, <hi>Remember me, O my God, and ſpare me,</hi> Nehem. 13. 22. with infinite the like. Our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of Chriſt in this Supper ſets awork all that is within us; Our ſorrow for ſinne, as <hi>Peters</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of his words, when the Cock crew, <hi>Mark 14. 72.

What would the ſight of Chriſt bleeding on the creſs for us, groaning under our ſins, have wrought on tender heart? The ſame, as far as a reflexion can work (which is weaker than the direct <hi>Species</hi>) ſhould be the temper of our hearts, when we ſee him and his death perſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and acted in this Sacrament, here we ſee him dying, paying our ranſome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Oh the dreadfull example of Gods juſtice upon ſin!

<pb n="150" facs="tcp:115895:84"/> broken, that they might thrive as the people on the Sea-coaſt do by the wrack; They (I ſay) while ſome were labouring, and all were waiting for to have Gods order ſtamped by civil Authority, not to give eſteem or value to that which is of God, but to make it more currant with us; As the ſtamp makes not the gold more precious, but more currant in common Uſe; While I ſay ſome were endeavouring this, or haply ſome of you will ſay, <hi>While men ſlept the envious man ſowed his tares,</hi> and took his opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of that long vacation, as <hi>Iſrael</hi> did of <hi>Moſes</hi> his abſence in the Mount, and they planted their bat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tery here upon this Sacrament, and cried down pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuous Communions with all their might, laying a good foundation, That onely viſible Saints are fit Communicants, which is true as to the Churches Admiſſion; That real Saints only are worthy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants, which is true too, as to the inward grace or benefit, but then, as alwayes in ſuch caſes it is the ſuperſtructure was hay and ſtubble; That Saints are only ſuch as are of their making and judging; And, That they that are of their opinion or party, though vicious in life and empty of true grace, are Saints; and thence come the ſeveral Communions and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions moulded up together into ſeveral bodies, for and by intereſts, paſſions and worldly ends, which I ſpeak not of all, for ſome godly ſouls might be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away to enjoy this Sacrament in a Communion more pleaſing to them, as <hi>Aaron</hi> was in the buſineſſe of the golden Calf, and others were mightily taken with it, who hardly paſſing for honeſt men at home in their own Churches, were preſently canonized for Saints, <hi>All the Congregation are Saints, every
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:115895:84"/> one of them,</hi> ſaith <hi>Corah,</hi> Numb. 16. 3.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When I look upon the ſtanding Miniſters, who ſhould diſpenſe the Sacrament, I muſt plead this for them, that while it is their intention and practiſe to make the door of this Sacrament no wider, no nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower than Chriſt hath made it, they cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. It may be ſo wide, as to let in the uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed to the Paſſeover, and bring Greeks into the Temple, as they ſaid of <hi>Paul.</hi> It may be ſo narrow, as to ſhut out fit and worthy Communicants for cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, for meer ceremonies, as in former times; There is great difference between Chriſts real members and gueſts at this Table, and as I may ſay the viſible Churches members or gueſts; If he be a viſible Profeſſour of faith unſhipwrackt, of capacity to diſcern the Lords body, of life without ſcandal, he is a gueſt of the Church, and yet not haply a true member of Chriſt, but a Jew outwardly in letter, a <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> a <hi>Judas,</hi> an hypocrite; We are not <hi>Domini,</hi> but <hi>Diſpenſatores,</hi> Lords of the Sacrament we are not, Stewards we may be, but the Steward cannot invite to his Maſters Table, whom the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter will not have his gueſt, nor ſhut out any whom the Maſter hath invited; The Prieſts that were par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial in the Law, did God make baſe and contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble before the people, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 9. and their partiality was in admitting the blinde, lame and blemiſht Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of the rich, or of their friends: Such partiality will embaſe the Miniſters of Chriſt, and the Lord taxes the Propheteſſes for like partiality, <hi>Ezek. 13. 19. For handfuls of barley, and pieces of bread, they ſlay the ſouls that ſhould not die; they ſave the ſouls alive that ſhould not live;</hi> Theſe are the two extreams,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:115895:85"/> which as applied to our purpoſe is to ſhut the door a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them that ſhould come in, and open the door to them that ſhould not enter, which if any do for handfuls of barley <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for partial reſpects and carnal ends, their ſin is great.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If we look on the generality of people in this Land, they are not prepared, and which is worſe, they will not be. How many are bruits for their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and beaſts for their lives? The onely way to bring them and the Sacrament together, is either to ſtoop the Ordinance to them, and being ſo ſet on tilt, I fear it will runne dregs, or to elevate and lift them up to the Ordinance, and that's the only way to be attempted; God grant ſucceſſe. When the ignorant, ſuperſtitious, prophane are weeded out, the Garden will hardly look green; Theſe are they that hold up old corruptions; Religion is nothing with them but an ancient cuſtome, or tradition received from father to ſon, <hi>The high-places were not taken away, for as yet the people had not prepared their heart to the God of their Fathers,</hi> 2. Chron. 20. 33. For the fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe of thoſe places where ſecurity, ſenſleſneſſe of ſpiritual things, oppoſition, is predominant, this Rule would be laid, That there is no Reaſon to deny thoſe that are godly the liberty of performance of this duty, or enjoyment of this benefit; Why are they ſtarved, becaUſe others will not, or ought not to eat? Did the Church that lived amongſt Jews or Heathens alwayes want this Sacrament? They were ſometimes diſturbed and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, when the Civil Magiſtrate turned the edge of the Axe toward them; but they loſt not the Ordinance. Why but we have no rule eſtabliſht by
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:115895:85"/> Civil Authority, or rather no Government: Nor had the Primitive Church for 300 years, when the vigour of Diſcipline was ſtrongeſt; How was their Diſcipline of force, <hi>Per pacta conventu,</hi> by conſent, whereby all Diſcipline is valid. He that will be of our body, muſt ſubmit to the Laws and Rules of that Corporation he is free of, whether to be enfran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſed or disfranchiſed: What if wicked men break in and abUſe our Sacrament? what if Heathens had ſo done in the Primitive Church? If they eat our bread, it's no Sacrament to them. If extream vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence be Uſed or feared, we have the protection of the Magiſtrate, or as the firſt Chriſtians, we have our hoUſes to break the Lords bread in.</p>

Anthony;</hi> and therefore it is ſuitable to the end of this Sacrament, to be exerciſing our memories, mindes and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the peruſall of Chriſt Jeſus. I know that ſome Churches Uſe to ſing a Pſalm, while the action is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming, whom I condemn not, as a means to keep the heart intent, and in ſpirituall frame or fixedneſs, but ſhould rather chUſe a ſilent meditation and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of the minde in the remembrance of Chriſt, for that's more ſuitable to the end of this Ordinance, and to Chriſts example and inſtitution, who according to the cuſtom of the Jews filled the time of action with commemoration, and cloſed it with a Hymn: and if we may give credit to the Jewiſh Writers, and others out of them, as <hi>Hugo Broughton</hi> ſhews in his Commentaries on <hi>Daniel,</hi> the Pſalms of the Hallel or Hymn ſung by the Jews, was the 113, 114, and ſo onward; and it's very probable that Chriſt and the Apoſtles did not here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in vary, for they ſung a Hymn at the cloſe, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 30. which example I need not ſtand
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:115895:87"/> to improve againſt the Anti-pſalmiſts of this age.</p>
                  <p>There are ſeverall pertinent meditations that may fully take up the time of the action with great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage and benefit to our ſouls, as namely,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The dreadfulneſs of Gods juſtice which with a terrible ſtroak did ſmite the great Shepherd for our ſins, the leaſt dram of it would have ſunk us to all eternity.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The curſed nature of ſinne that ſo exaſperates the holy God, and makes ſuch a breach between God and the creature, as can never be made up but by the broken body of the Lord of Glory.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. What it coſt to redeem a ſoul, a maſs of gold as big as the whole earth, not valuable with one drop of this blood.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. What an infinite love broke forth, that God, rather than let our ſouls be loſt, would ſend his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Son, and make him ſin for us.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. What a great work it is to reconcile a ſinner to his God, all names of men and Angels are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to it, all their ſufferings would not pay a penny of this debt, which is not diſſolved by any blood but of the Lord of Glory.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. That God would not only pardon ſin, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving forth a generall pardon, as a King pardons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels; but ſo pardon, as might even melt the hardeſt heart, and for ever humble, and ſilence, and ſatisfie it by the love of God, and the ſufficiency of that Sacrifice, whoſe vertue extends to thouſands, and laſts alwaies.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. That the gratious Covenant of God made with all that beleeeve in Chriſt, is ſealed and ratified with
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:115895:88"/> ſuch blood, as there needs no doubt of the validity of the Covenant, though one man bad as many ſins on him as all the world.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. That Gods way of ſaving man by a Mediatour, the death of a Mediatour, doth oblige man to be the thankfulleſt creature in the world: Angels that ſin'd not, have need of no Mediatour; Angels that ſin'd have none; man that ſin'd, and therefore needs one, hath one given to him, <hi>The man Christ Jeſus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. That as God gave Chriſt for you, ſo he gives him to you, that he that was your Sacrifice offered up to God, might in this Sacrament be offered unto you, as meat and drink, as ſpirituall repaſt, that as we live by Chriſt, ſo we may live upon him, being entertained as confederates to feaſt with God upon the Sacrifice offered up unto him. It is a fruitfull field of Meditation, through which ye may walk the time of celebration, and then breathe out your Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations in a Song of praiſe, as the cloſe and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick of this heavenly Feaſt: Concerning which Hymn, wherewith the Jews did uſually cloſe the <hi>coenam apolyticam,</hi> or dimiſſory Supper, calling it the <hi>Hallel,</hi> from the firſt word of it <hi>Hallelujah,</hi> you may conſult not only the Jewiſh Writers, but our Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, <hi>Cameron Myroth in</hi> Matth. 16. 30. <hi>Druſius in</hi> Matth. 26. 30. <hi>Hugo Broughton in</hi> Dan. <hi>pag.</hi> 46. beſide <hi>Paulus Burgenſis, Gerard Harm.

               <p>VVHen this Ordinance of the Supper is ſuitable to the Inſtitution, and the Communicant is ſuitable to the Ordinance, then all is right. Of the former I have acquitted my ſelf, by ſetting forth the nature, Uſe, end of this Sacrament, according to our Lords Inſtitution, recited by the Evangeliſts, and by S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:115895:89"/> ſpeak, but the Apoſtle in this place ſpeaks more fully and directly unto, than in any other place is found, the abUſes and diſtempers of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> leading him moſt properly to it; and though in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Churches the grand errour and abUſe lies in the unſutableneſs of their Maſs to the Inſtitution, yet in Reformed Churches, who endeavour to imitate the pattern in the Mount, the common ſin lies in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſutableneſs of the Communicant to the Ordinance; and ſo the point of worſhip ſtands between us; and the Papiſts, much alike as it ſtood between the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritans and the Jews of old, The Samaritans Uſed a falſe worſhip, <hi>Ye worſhip ye know not what,</hi> Joh. 4. 22. The Jews had a true worſhip, but were carnall, and for the moſt part formall worſhippers. The Feaſt is prepared, dreſt, and ordered according to the Inſtitution of Chriſt: Now the gueſts are to be ſurveyed and tried, whether they come worthily or unworthily, by the teſt or ticket of the Apoſtles Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine following to the end of the Chapter; of which I ſhall ſay this in generall.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Apoſtles Doctrine in this place is properly calculated for the rectifying the abUſes and unworthineſs of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> as ye may ſee at the 33, 34, verſes, but ſo alſo moſt other Scriptures oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally written, are of generall Uſe, their latitude is greater than their particular direction.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Apoſtle ſpends the moſt of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine upon eating and drinking unworthily, ſetting home the ſin and danger of it, for, the occaſion, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſinne of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> required it; and yet doubtleſs the point of worthineſs, ſhould in order of nature be firſt ſtated, before unworthineſs can
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:115895:89"/> be underſtood, for how ſhould I know ſinne, except firſt I knew a law of duty; how a crooked line, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept I know what is ſtraight: and therefore to attent conſideration, the Apoſtle will be found to begin there, as I ſhall ſhew you afterwards.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the Apoſtle in ſetting home the ſinne and danger of eating and drinking unworthily, ſpeaks thunder and lightning in very pertinent, but yet new and unuſuall phraſes, which are <gap reason="foreign">

Theſe of the 26 verſe are the words of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul,</hi> who having recited what Chriſt did and ſaid at the firſt celebration and inſtitution of this Sacrament, goes about to ſet his <hi>Corinthian</hi> commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants to right, teaching them and us, what is the meaning of this Ordinance, and what the <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>The words have no difficulty, but what may beſt be opened in every point as it comes to hand: The firſt Point ſhall be from the connexion or whole words:</p>

<pb n="162" facs="tcp:115895:90"/> Outward Ordinances conſiſting of viſible matter, as moſt of the Jewiſh Ordinances did, and our Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments do, do ordinarily terminate and bound the eye of the ignorant, that cannot, and of the Chriſtian outwardly, that doth not look within the rinde or ſhell of them: The time is not loſt that's beſtowed either by us in the anatomy and opening, or by you in learning and ſpelling out the minde and meaning of an Ordinance of God. <hi>When your children,</hi> Exod. 12. 26. <hi>ſhall ſay unto you, What mean you by this ſervice? ye ſhall ſay, It is the ſacrifice of the Lords Paſſeover,</hi> &amp;c.

This was the veil that covered the eye of the Jews, they had Sacrifices, Waſhings, manifold Rites, but were not able to ſpell and put together, they generally little dreamd of the meaning of them, but were as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle cals them, <hi>Jews outwardly and in the letter;</hi> for it pleaſed God in the times of that diſpenſation, to give his people the kernell, but incloſed in a hard ſhell; to give them a pillar of fire, but in a cloud; to hide the light in a dark lanthorne, to convey the truth in ſhadows. Now that the Obſcurity is taken off the Ordinances, there remains an ignorance upon our hearts, and many of us know as little the meaning of our Sacraments, as the Jews did of theirs; there is ſcarce any of our ignorant, ſuperſtitious, prophane perſons, but they think there is ſome holineſs in this Sacrament, and therefore they put on a poſture of ſome reverence for the time, but the particular Uſe of it, or the ſpirituall importance they know not, and therefore reſt in the <hi>opus operatum,</hi> and receive
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:115895:90"/> the Sacrament as a medicinall potion naturally work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or worſhip that which ſhould be made Uſe of by faith, for the nouriſhment of the ſoul.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>3</label> The Uſe of this point may be for Inſtruction of both Miniſter and people.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The Miniſter is hereby taught, That it is not only his duty to give the Sacrament, but alſo to teach the Sacrament; he gives the outward Elements, he teaches the inward meaning of them; he gives the bone, and ſhews the marrow that is in it; otherwiſe you take the Sacrament by rote, and he gives you <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegram nucem,</hi> as <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith, a whoſe nut, to a child that cannot crack it, and ſo partakes in that ſin and guilt being dumb, which you contract being blinde. Our Saviour when he gave the Bread and the Cup, ſaid alſo, <hi>This is my Body, This Cup is the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in my Blood,</hi> and ſo taught the meaning. S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> when he had recited the Inſtitution, ſhews the mind of it, <hi>As oft as ye eat, ye ſhew the Lords death.</hi> And you are to be taught what is Gods meaning, and what is the meaning of your own actions; Gods meaning is to make a repreſentation of Chriſts death and ſufferings, by the breaking of the bread, and to afford you the communion of his Body and Blood, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 16. The meaning of your actions is to make commemoration of Chriſt, and to ſhew forth his death: Gods meaning is to dreſs out Chriſt in beſt manner and fitteſt for a ſinner, Chriſt broken, Chriſt bleeding; and the meaning of your eating and drinking, is to feed ſorrowfully and ſweetly upon Chriſt, ſo prepared and preſented to you, for your repaſt and comfort. But now, if the ſame cup taken with ſuch ingredients, would be deadly poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:115895:91"/> with ſuch a lively Cordiall, would you not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that the Phyſician ſhould teach you to make it Cordiall, ſo the Lords Supper worthily received, is the moſt ſoveraign Cordiall: But ſome again may eat and drink damnation to themſelves, Would you not expect that the Miniſter, if he have either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of his duty, or reſpect to your ſouls, ſhould teach you to avoid the danger and obtain the benefit? If you do not, yet God looks for it at our hands, <hi>Ezek. 44. 23. And they</hi> (the Prieſts) <hi>ſhall teach my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the difference between the holy and prophane, and caUſe men to diſcern between the unclean and clean;</hi> for elſe you may eat and drink damnation to us, as well as to your ſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>4</label> Secondly, The people are taught, To know the meaning of the Sacrament, before they take it: That's a terrible expreſſion, <hi>ver. 29. He eats and drinks damnation to himſelf not diſcerning the Lords Body,</hi> that is, not knowing the meaning, the nature, Uſe and end of the Ordinance, which to underſtand is a good part of preparation, and without it, there can be no right or true preparation. And therefore all you that intend to be Supper-communicants, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend: The firſt leſſon which you muſt learn, the firſt Queſtion to be anſwered is, What is the true meaning of this Ordinance? what is the main bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of it? for it is ſuppoſed in thoſe words, <hi>Exod. 12. 26. When your children ſhall ſay to you, What mean you by this ſervice, (i.</hi> Paſſeover,) that the father ſhould be able to teach his childe, as it is there di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, and that the child ſhould, as his firſt leſſon be taught what is meant, To know what the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Ordinance is.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:115895:91"/>1. It is a proper and excellent antidote or remedy of ſuch abUſes and miſcarriages as creep in at the door, either of ignorance, ſuperſtition, or prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and the Apoſtle ſignifies ſo much here, by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying this corrective to thoſe diſtempers which then reigned in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> as if he had ſaid, Could you come and eat and drink ſo rudely, proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, confUſedly, irreverently, unworthily, if ye did conſider but what ye ought to do? that is, exerciſe communion with Chriſt, keep a commemoration of him, ſhew forth his death.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This will direct all your preparations to the true end, your praiers, meditations, ſelf-examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, will be anſwerable and ſuitable to the Ordinance. Here is not the eating of a piece of bread, nor the drinking of a cup of wine in a publique company of ſober men and of my betters (which yet is enough to the putting on my better clothes, and framing my ſelf to a grave compoſure) but here I am to meet my Lord Chriſt, and to receive him as my Saviour, I am to have the Covenant of mercy ſealed to me in his blood; I am to make a thankfull memoriall of Chriſt, and to profeſs my embracement and adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to his death, as my only comfort; therefore be thou awakened, O my faith, my godly ſorrow, my ſpirituall appetite, my thankfulneſs, that I may go out to Chriſt, and he come in to me.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This takes off all ſlighting and undervaluing of this Ordinance, which appears to an outward and carnall eye, No better bread or wine than I can have at home, for in this plain caſe is a rich Jewel, this bread is the body, this wine is the Blood of the Lord of Glory; and therefore I muſt not value the ſeal by
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:115895:92"/> the worth of the wax, which is not worth a penny, but by the pardon, or the inheritance, which paſſes, and is conveyed by it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This keeps me from running blindfold into the ſin of guiltineſs of the Body and Blood of the Lord, and ſo into condemnation, for as the ſame Signet or Seal of a Prince, doth to one ſeal a pardon, to another an execution; ſo this very Sacrament is to a Beleever a ſeal of pardon, to another, as it were, the ſeal of his condemnation.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Laſtly, The preparation ſo much ſpoken of, and the ſelf-examination required by the Apoſtle, cannot be imagined to referre to the eating of bread and drinking wine, but to the inward thing of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: it neceſſarily follows that thoſe inward graces that enable us to have communion with Chriſt, and make commemoration of him, can never be known or ſought, except we know the meaning of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, for it is that which gives the Law and Rule of all our preparations. And ſo I have ſhown you the Reaſons why we ſhould labour to underſtand the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of this Ordinance.</p>
               <p>So much of this generall Point, the ſecond Point ſhall be taken from thoſe words, <hi>Ye ſhew the Lords death,</hi> or <hi>ſhew ye,</hi> for the word might be conſtrued imparatively, but that the particle [<hi>For</hi>] would not then ſo well conſiſt.</p>

The two ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sacraments of the Goſpel, do alſo referre to death, <hi>We are buried with him by Baptiſm, into death, Rom.</hi> 6. 4. and in the Supper, <hi>we ſhew the Lords death.</hi> As of all deliverances and benefits vouchſafed to <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old, God would have the Paſſeover-delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance celebrated by a conſtant memoriall in all gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations; ſo of all that Chriſt doth for us, it is his death that muſt be ſhewn forth in all generations of the Church, till he come again: and therefore this Ordinance is <hi>ſpeculum crucifixi,</hi> as <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith; and <note place="margin">

This death hath no ſecond in all the world, for it was the death of the Sonne of God, the death of the Lamb of God.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:115895:93"/>1. Of the Sonne of God, the Lord of Glory, whoſe highneſs and excellency gave price and value to his death.

               <p n="2">2. Of the Lamb of God, and therefore his death was a Sacrifice, and that's more than a Martyrdom; for though a Martyr may be ſaid to ſeal with his blood that truth he dies upon, yet no blood can ſeal the Covenant but this of Chriſt, no death can ratifie the Teſtament but the Teſtators death: Had the death been the death of the Lord, a moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent perſon, and not alſo the death of a Lamb for Sacrifice, to make attonement, it had wanted one of his properties, but it was both. As it was the death of the Lord of Glory, the Sonne of God, ſo it gave us the moſt illuſtrious teſtimony and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the love of God, as ever was or could be, and that the Scripture often points unto. As it was the death of the Lamb of God, ſo it was a Sacrifice death, wherein he was made ſinne for us, and bore our ſinnes in his Body. As it was the <note place="margin">Joh. 11. 13. Rom. 5.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>2</label> Secondly, It is the buſineſs of the Communicant to ſhew forth this death of the Lord: The Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance it ſelf is full of death, what other language doth bread broken, and the blood ſevered from the
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:115895:93"/> body, ſpeak but a dying Chriſt: As the Ordinance, ſo the Communicant doth by eating and drinking, in fact declare and annunciate his profeſſion of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence to, and embracement of the death of Chriſt, we ſolemnly and publiquely avow, both to God and men, that we ſtick unto, and abide by the death of the Lord, for remiſſion of ſinne, and reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of our perſons to God; and it is a ſolemn part of Gods poſitive worſhip, to ſhew forth the death of Chriſt our Lord, not by a meer hiſtoricall relation, but a practicall and publique profeſſion of our faith, and acceptance thereof, which though at all times we may remember, yet God would have a ſolemn Ordinance in his Goſpel-Churches, for the commemoration and ſhewing of it forth, which Ordinance is this of the Supper. I know men are witty to elude Ordinances, and to flatter themſelves with private devotions and meditations, but when God hath ſet up an Ordinance on purpoſe, for the publique and ſolemn ſhewing of the Lords death; let them conſider it, that are not only careleſs of the benefit of it, but fail of their duty, by not preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves at this ſolemn ſhewing of the Lords death: but how can it be expected that they that ſhew not the life of Chriſt by a godly converſation, ſhould care to ſhew forth his death by publique pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; or rather, how can it be conſtrued that they do it out of conſcience of duty, and not out of meer ſuperſtition, expecting that from the Sacrament, which the Papiſt expects from his auricular confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that is, to quit the old ſcore, that he may more freely begin upon a new.</p>

He that ſhall come,</hi> he ſhall appear the ſecond time, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 28. as in the old Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> there was a glorious Temple, then a captivity that followed; after the captivity a ſecond Temple, and then Chriſt came; So in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-Churches, there was firſt a glorious Virgin pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church, then followed a captivity under An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, and that captivity ſhall be followed with a ſecond Temple, a Reformed Church, and then Chriſt ſhall come again; but as the Church of God waited neer four thouſand years from the firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Chriſt made to <hi>Adam,</hi> to his firſt coming, ſo ſhall the Church of the Goſpel wait many years

               <p>Secondly, This Ordinance of the Supper is to continue till Chriſt come; the meaning is not, That men ſhall not deface and diſhonour it in ſome places, but that it ſhall continue in force, though not in Uſe: God will not alter or diſcharge it, and the like, for there is the like Reaſon may be ſaid of other ſtanding Ordinances of worſhip. The Jewiſh Paſſeover was an Ordinance for ever, but that <hi>ever</hi> had an end when Chriſt came; and the Ordinances of that Church, though they might be defaced and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a time, yet were in force till Chriſts firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſo the Goſpel-Sacraments, Worſhip, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:115895:97"/> and (may it pleaſe you) Miniſtry ſhall be in force, and God grant in Uſe, for the time of their Ever, and that is Chriſts ſecond coming. The legal Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices and Ordinances were (as the Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 27.</note> the Prophet) to be ſhaken down and removed by the bringing in of a better Covenant, and other Ordinances by Chriſt Jeſus, but the Ordinances of the Goſpel cannot be ſhaken, are never to be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by any other Ordinance, or any new Church, but onely to ceaſe and expire with the worlds end. The Scripture cloſes and ſhuts it ſelf up with this, <hi>Come Lord Jeſus,</hi> Rev. 22. 20.</p>

                  <hi>Worthineſs</hi> is relative, and refers to the rule of the action, which here is the inſtitution, the Nature, Uſe and End of this Sacrament: for to eat and drink worthily, is to do it anſwerably and ſuitably to the Ordinance, when the Communicant hath, and ſo exerciſes ſuch graces, qualifications and deportment, inward and outward, as this Sacrament doth require, beſpeak and call for; And the contrary is unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, when the manner of communicating, or the Communicant is not ſuitable or anſwerable to the Ordinance, either becaUſe he hath not, or exerciſeth not the qualifications, that the Sacrament requires in a worthy receiver, or brings a contrary diſpoſition to it, and this interpretation is eaſie, natural and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing; for the Apoſtle layes down the inſtitution firſt, and then infers what receiving unworthily is, as a ſtrait Rule diſcovers a crooked line by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliance of it to the Rule; and thus the Scripture, which advances not the merit, but the meetneſſe of actions and perſons, Uſeth to ſpeak, as <hi>Epheſ. 4. 1.

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:115895:101"/> ſin and ſuſpenſion from the Lords board, which ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of Diſcipline, though full of ſharpneſſe and aſperity, yet the reverence of this Ordinance, the Heathens among whom they lived, that watched for their haltings, and the great temptations to Idolatry and Apoſtaſie, by fear of perſecutions and continual Alarms, may plead ſome excUſe of that ſeverity: In ſhort, though ſome have made the gate wider than others, yet all have impaled the Ordinance, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it from the common; The Word indeed preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or read lies open to all: the high wayes and hedges may be compell'd in to fill up the place where it ſounds, and Baptiſm may be adminiſtred at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, for imitation and liſting of ſouldiers under Chriſts colours: but the Lords Supper ever was <hi>intra Cancellos,</hi> within the mound, for it is the inmoſt Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance that we have, for Church-members, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, not lying open to the ſtreets, but as an inner room within a room, an Ordinance for fellowſhip of Saints and Chriſtians, that are paſt the Font; All have not right to it, and ſome that have had right, may for the time have forfeited and loſt their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>2. A viſible profeſſour of Chriſtian Religion, that ſtains not his profeſſion with a wicked courſe of life, or ſome ſcandalous act, cannot be debarred his right of Communion with the viſible Church in her pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges; Many are in the external Covenant and Kingdom of Chriſt, who are not truly regenerate, nor lively members of Chriſt himſelf; inward grace makes a member of the Church inviſible, and the profeſſion makes a viſible. The Sacraments are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the viſible Church, we cannot diſcern or judge
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:115895:112"/> infallibly, who is regenerate, who an hypocrite, a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Judge is not to go by an inviſible rule, <hi>You ſhall know them</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>by their fruits:</hi> He doth not ſay, You ſhall know them by their ſap; It's one Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, Who is a true member of Chriſts body, and truly in Chriſt? It's another Queſtion, Whom we may communicate with? It's one Queſtion, Who comes and eats, and drinks unworthily? So do hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites: It's another Queſtion, Who may not come at all? and thoſe are viſible unbelievers, and ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous perſons, <hi>uſitatiſsima phraſi</hi> (ſaith <hi>Chemnitius</hi>) in the moſt uſual phraſe of Scripture they are called ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Saints, who are Saints by calling, Diſciples of Chriſt, ſeparated from infidelity and Heatheniſm unto the worſhip of God by their faith of the Goſpel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It muſt be evidence of ſome fact, or diſorderly walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which is proved, that muſt give ground to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common or diſ-franchize a reputed Member, Who ever heard of witneſſes to prove a man unregenerate? Oh but in judgement of charity at leaſt, he muſt be truly regenerate! <hi>I would all the Congregation were holy;</hi> That's the beſt corn-field that hath feweſt weeds or tares, but (as I conceive) the Church is to proceed by an infallible Rule, not a judgement of charity; Charity gives a good temperament unto our judgement, and holds the balance mercifully, but God hath ſet a Rule to judge by, <hi>If one that is named a brother be a fornicatour, or Idolater, or a railer, or drunkard,</hi> 1 Cor. 5. 11. It is the viſible Rule of his own word, who may, and who may not be debarred our fellowſhip or ſociety; Charity may hold the ſcales, but the ſcales are Gods word, which tels us, who are <hi>inter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>3. No ſecret ſinne that lies in the boſom of the heart, is a ſufficient ground of a mans being debarred or prohibited by the Church to come to this Table. It may be a caUſe of a mans eating and drinking un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily, but of his debarment to come, it cannot be; It may be a caUſe of forbearance to come, not of prohibition; and the Reaſon is, <hi>De ſecretis non judicat Eccleſia,</hi> ſecret ſins are without the Churches cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance: Our Saviour tels us, <hi>Matth. 5. 28.

                  <p>But this example pleads nothing for admiſſion of openly notorious and ſcandalous ſinners; for though Chriſt knew <hi>Judas,</hi> yet his ſins had not yet ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly broke forth, and therefore he was preſent, as a ſecret ſinner, of whom there could be no juſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation, nor evident proof, and ſo no object as yet of any eccleſiaſtical cenſure in an ordinary and orderly <note place="margin">

                  <p>4. No private treſpaſſe againſt a private ſcandal gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to a Chriſtian brother, is the immediate object of this debarment from publick Communion, for in ſuch caſes there is an order, <hi>viz.</hi> The golden Rule of Chriſt is to be Obſerved, <hi>Matth. 18. 15. Go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone, if he hear thee, thou haſt gained thy brother; if not then, take one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witneſses every word may be eſtabliſht; If yet he hear not, or neglect, Tell it to the Church;</hi> The bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe here to be done, is not ſo much to reſarciate the damage or injury done to thee, or to make him pay what he owes, that belongs to <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>-Hall, not the Church, but to gain a brother to repent, that's the work. And here we may complain of a great neglect of this duty of private reproof or admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition: Men would have their private offences brought upon the publick ſtage, at firſt daſh they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the Church ſhould proceed to do their work at firſt inſtance, they forget that, <hi>Levit. 19. 17. Thou ſhalt not hate thy brother in thine heart, thou ſhalt in any wiſe rebuke thy neighbour, and not ſuffer ſinne upon him.</hi> The Church would have leſſe to doe, if this courſe were held, the matter would be ſtopt, the offendour gained by this private plaiſter, which if it do the cure, what need we go to the Chyrurgion: Men have their own private plaiſters, and untill the ſore rankle, they call not the Chyrurgions to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel: Men are apt to runne to the Church or Miniſter with private whiſpers, and what can they do by Gods Word upon private whiſpers, juſt nothing, go and do your own duty: Let Chriſts order be Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, He will not have a member of the Church made
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:115895:115"/> a Publican or Heathen at firſt daſh, there are three neglectings to hear before that be, <hi>If he hear not thee, If he hear not two or three, If he hear not the Church,</hi> but if he do hear thee, then no end of bringing two or three; If he hear two or three, then no telling of the Church; If he hear the Church, then is he no Heathen or Publican unto thee: How raſhly and paſſionately do many ſeparate from the Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caUſe ſhe cannot, doth not caſt out her members up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their private whiſpers, let them go and ſeperate alſo from the Commonwealth, becaUſe ſhe doth not baniſh or put to death upon private information. Do they neglect their own duty to their brother, and will they make the Church a Heathen and a Publican to them, for not doing that which by Chriſts order they cannot do?</p>
                  <p>5. The proper, and adequate, and immediate ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of this debarment from the Communion of the Church, is a ſcandalous perſon, that holds either a courſe, or hath committed the act of a ſcandalous ſinne, And what call you that?

<pb n="213" facs="tcp:115895:115"/> they bring ſcandal on the Church, provoke God, blot out our comfort, waſte the conſcience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but there are quotidian ſinnes of daily incurſion, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all godly men, infirmities, which like little flies are not to be knockt down with ſo great a ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, whoſe abſolute cure can hardly be expected, or performed by ſuch as are ſubject to the like paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons themſelves; divorce or baniſhment are too great, but for ſuch offences as are directly <hi>contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riant</hi> to the reſpective ſocieties of marriage or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.</p>

                  <p>Sixthly, No private perſon by any private Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, can diſpoſſeſs a viſible member of his right of Communion; As in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth Juſtice is neceſſary, but private perſons doe not bear the Sword. It's unReaſonable that a man laying claime to the Ordinance ſhould at any mans private diſcretion be denied, What inconveniences and miſchiefes would this fill the Church of God with? How full of ſcandals? This would not heal ſcandals, but make them.
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:115895:116"/> Nor can I warrant or encourage any private or ſingle Miniſter ordinarily to aſſume the power of juriſdiction, to caſt out of the Church, as it once did <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> 2 Epiſt. of <hi>John</hi> verſ. 10. and I ſay ordinarily, becaUſe Saint <hi>Paul</hi> deliver'd to Satan <hi>Hymenaeus</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 20. For the Paſtour is not <hi>Dominus,</hi> but <hi>Diſpenſator Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentorum,</hi> (as <hi>Alenſis</hi> ſaith) not the Head of the Sacraments, but the Steward; And it would goe very ill with the beſt Communicants many times, if the power lay in that hand. He that preaches againſt them would make no bones to forbid them the Table, and they that leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferved it ſhould feel the ſeverity moſt; but our Saviour his Rule is, <hi>Tell the Church;</hi> and that <note place="margin">Matth. 18.</note> rebuke which was given to the inceſtuous <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian,</hi> was inflicted by many, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 6. It's true, The Miniſter may alone performe the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive part, and pronounce the words, as the Crier doth the Proclamation, and peradventure withdraw his hand from reaching forth the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to a ſcandalous perſon, but that is no act of Juriſdiction, or caſting out the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous perſon, as I ſhall (it may be) ſhew a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, The Church it ſelfe doth not ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily caſt out a meritorious ſinner without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Admonition, and hearty ſeeking of a loſt Sheep; for there are few that would cut off an unſound Leg or Arme, before they had tried all wayes; And our Saviour ſaith, <hi>If he neglect to hear the Church,</hi> (Matth. 18. 17.) as implying,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:115895:117"/> That the Church deals with him by Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and entreaties, ſuch as may overcome his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy, rather then puniſh it, and had rather heal him than cut him off. And ſo in the firſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Poſition, I fortified the Sacrament againſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due Intruſion: And in this ſecond I have forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the Right of the Communicant againſt unjuſt invaſion.</p>
                  <p>And having ſhewed you the truth of this Point in two generall Poſitions; The firſt was, That this Ordinance is barred, and lies not open to all that may intrude. The ſecond was, That the right of a viſible Church-member is hedged in, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be hand over head invaded, and taken away from him.

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>1</label> THat the truth lies between theſe two. I ſay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a forcible Entry, or violent Intruſion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Ordinance, and an unjuſt invaſion of the Communicants right; For both the Ordinance it ſelf, and right of the Communicant are hedged in; As in all Corporations, whoſoever will, may not intrude into the freedom, nor yet the rights belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that freedom be taken away, but in an orderly way. That which God hath made common, we may not incloſe or make ſeveral, <hi>viz.</hi> the Goſpel or preaching thereof, and that which God hath made ſeveral, we may not make common, that is, this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; As he cannot allow this Table to any that are not of the hoUſe, ſo neither can we turn out of the hoUſe ſuch as have right to come to this Table: Some are diſpleaſed that they ſhould not have the ſame right to the Word, and to the Table; No, for as thou art a ſinfull man, thou haſt a right, and duty to hear the Goſpel, though an Heathen, but not to this Sacrament, till thou be a Chriſtian, and duly qualified profeſſour of Chriſt: Are you not pleas'd
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:115895:118"/> that God gives you a nearer and more inward admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance unto Communion and fellowſhip with Chriſt, than to Jews and Infidels, and ſuch as are called Chriſtians, but little better than they? Would you not have him make more of his children, than of common ſervants? While you would raiſe up a right unto wicked men to Gods inner Ordinance, you do but depreſſe and lay low the difference and favour, which he vouchſafes to his Covenant people; A King may ſend a Proclamation of pardon to rebels, while the Sword is in their hand, but he ſeals it not to them, or invites them to his Table, till they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit and accept conditions.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>2</label> No private grudge, or diſtance, or animoſity of any man in authority can warrant the diſpoſſeſſion of any juſt right of a Communicant to this Ordinance. I have told you already, We are not Lords of the Sacrament, but Stewards; the Table is the Lords Table, not ours; No ſervant can upon any private grudge againſt his fellow-ſervant forbid him the hoUſe or table provided by the Maſter; No private Citizen can forbid the priviledge and rights of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to his fellow-citizen; This is but the exerciſing of private revenge by the way of Gods publick Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, and to proſtitute the ſame to our envy and malice; <hi>The King ſaid to his ſervants, binde him hand and foot, that hath not the wedding-garment, and take him away,</hi> Matth. 27. 13. The King ſaid it, Let all the Lords ſervants take heed of caſting out any, but upon the Lords warrant, and upon his command. I ſhould tremble that my ſelf, or any elſe ſhould make my Office ſerve my private ſpleen, neither can any man loſe his right upon my ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:115895:118"/> or ſuſpicion of ſcandalous ſin, but clear and convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive evidence.</p>
               <p>And what I ſay of private grudge, I would be underſtood to ſay of private differences in opinion, ſpeculative or practick, provided they be ſuch as godly men do ordinarily diſſent in; or (as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith) <hi>Such things wherein the Kingdom of God conſists not,</hi> Rom. 14. 17. For <hi>verſ. 3. Let not him that eateth deſpiſe him that eats not. Let not him that eateth not, judge him that eats,</hi> and the Reaſon is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>verſ. 4. He is another mans ſervant, to his own Master he ſtands or fals.</hi> Such diſcord need break no muſick, we may as ſoon make all faces alike; as all judgements, and we ſhould not be ſo proud as to think all are Blackmores beſides us. <hi>For God hath received him</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 3. therefore let us receive him, and let him receive at the Lords board, and yet I would have no man think, that I dare ſpeak in favour of, or invite hereſie to the Lords Table; For as there is a great difference between our daily ſinnes, and thoſe we call ſcandalous, or flagrant, and atroci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ſo there is alſo between many errours of judgement, and pernicious hereſies; And if we compare ſuch hereſies with ſcandalous ſinnes of moral life, you ſhall finde, that hereſie is more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious and peſtilential, though the other may be as mortal; So the Plague is more to be avoided than the Dropſie: Hereſie overthrows the faith of other men more eaſily, than drunkenneſſe doth their morals by the example; By ſcandalous ſinnes we open others mouths to blaſpheme, by hereſie we our ſelves blaſpheme, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 20. And you finde
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:115895:119"/> that it is ſaid of hereſies, as it is of Adultery, Murder, <hi>They that doe ſuch things ſhall not inherit the Kingdome of God,</hi> Gal. 5. 19. And if there be any thing higher, it's ſaid, <hi>They bring upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſwift deſtruction,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 2. and therefore they are as farre removed from this Table, as any other.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>4</label> And what I have ſaid of private grudge, or private differences in judgement; I ſay, laſtly, of private reſpects or partiality, which neither ſhuts nor opens the door well; and if I were to allow or diſallow Communicants, I would not admit my near relations, Wife, Children, Servants, Kindred, Friends, but upon the ſame termes I would admit my enemy, his relations, his Wife, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; and if I ſhould diſallow any of them upon the ſame terms, I would forbid mine own, elſe were I a <note place="margin">Jam. 2. 4.</note> reſpecter of perſons, and a judge of evil thoughts; Nor would I ſtretch out my hand to a Parliament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and withdraw it from a Scavenger on the ſame termes; Nor ſhould a godly man, <hi>Flagranti in crimine,</hi> under the ſcandall of drunkenneſſe, or adultery, finde any more welcome than another man under the ſame ſinne, untill repentance made ſome difference; For ſtill I goe upon the ſame Rule or principle; The Table is not ours; We make not the Feaſt; We are not Lords and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Ordinance, but Stewards, Servitours, Diſpenſers, that muſt act <hi>ad voluntatem Domini.</hi>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>5</label> The third Uſe of this Point, may be to ſatisfie our querulous and complaining diſpoſitions, when we ſee many who are but Jewes outwardly, and they are no Jews; Many that have a forme, but not the power of godlineſſe: Many that <hi>walke

The Anſwer is, That violence muſt not be offer'd to that Rule, Order and way, which God hath ſet down for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting of any viſible member from his right. It's fit that thieves and robbers, and cheaters were either reformed or purged out of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, but yet it muſt be in the courſe of Law, or elſe the remedy would be a miſchief; <hi>That in the mouth of two or three Witneſſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> (ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 16.) <hi>every word may be eſtabliſht.</hi> It is not a thing to be done at randome, as I have ſhewed; Every ſore leg is not preſently to be cut off, there may be as ſore a one under a ſilk ſtoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king: The Church ſinnes, if ſhe neglect her duty; but I muſt tell you, That you muſt do your duty firſt. Have you (in private offences) gone firſt to your offenſive brother, and told him of his fault in private, and then if he be not gain'd, have you born witneſſe againſt him? And hath he been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of his ſinne by due conviction? Or doth he ſtand out againſt conviction and admonition? And is he Obſtinate, and doth perſiſt in his ſinne? One may murder a Felon, he ſhould haply die,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:115895:120"/> but he dies innocently, if he die by a private hand; A man that deſerves to be caſt out, may be caſt out injuriouſly, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>non judice.</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the Argument is plauſible, That the Church, the livelier and purer it is, the better it is, So the Corn-field is beſt that hath no weeds; The Corn that's clean dreſt from chaffe and cockle is the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, but it's rare to finde ſuch a field, or to finde ſuch a floor in the Garner, ſo it is, but not in the barn-floor. I like holineſſe which is of Gods ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, not that which is of mans making. The <hi>Novatians,</hi> or <hi>Cathari,</hi> the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> alſo pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both to a holineſſe above all the Churches of God in the world, but there is (as <hi>Calvin</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, none of them left in the world to be ſeen, whereas the true Churches of Chriſt continue, and I hope ſhall continue, though they be like <hi>Iſrael</hi> going forth of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> that had a mixt multitude among them, as the Scripture ſpeaks.</p>

I ſhall now proceed before I go further; Two or three Queſtions of moment and importance; The Anſwer to which will both clear the former Doctrine more fully, and alſo anticipate ſuch Objections, as may be raiſed up againſt it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. The firſt Queſtion is this, <hi>What is to be done in ſuch caſe, wherein the former Doctrine is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable, by Reaſon that the Church or particular ſociety, whereof thou art a member, be not in capacity to exerciſe ſuch Diſcipline, for want of ſuch due Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtratours as may bring to execution the aforeſaid order of Debarment from, or Admittance to the Lords Table?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before I anſwer this great Queſtion, I muſt tell you that I have caUſe to fear leaſt it be ſaid of me, as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaid of <hi>Cato, His opinion of, and affection to the Commonwealth is excellent good, but he is offenſive,</hi>
                  <pb n="224" facs="tcp:115895:121"/> Quia loquitur tanquam in Repub. Platonis, non tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam in faece Romuli, <hi>becaUſe he ſpeaks as if he were in</hi> Plato <hi>his Commonwealth, not as in the dregs of Romulus:</hi> So you may ſay, that I ſpeak as if I was in the Primitive Church, and not in the dregs of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, which profaneneſſe and ſuperſtition have brought in upon us; but notwithſtanding the Clock that goes falſe muſt be reduced by the Sunne-dial, and not that by the Clock that erres; We may juſtly complain of, and bewail the evil <hi>genius</hi> of the times and men, that if they can hear novelties every Lords<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day from ſome ambulatory Preachers, and they alſo can vapour up and down with two or three Sermons calculated to ſerve any Meridian, do not either look for, or prize a ſetled condition of Miniſtry and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments in the Church, but rather cry, So would we have it, <hi>Let every man do that which is right in his own eyes;</hi> and we little think that ſo many breach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and diſtractions are amongſt us, becaUſe we ſeek not the Lord after the due order. It was an old com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, that the coming in of the world into the Church was the decay of Chriſtianity, while Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours were Heathen, and perſecutions of the very name Chriſtian, were frequent, the Diſcipline was vigorous, when men came in to Chriſtianity with no other reſolution, than to ſuffer for it, and made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to ſave nothing by it, but their ſouls, the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline was able to keep them in compaſſe, but when Chriſtian Emperours came in, and ſet the broad gates open to the world, then they throng'd into Chriſtianity for faſhion, intereſt, preferment, as all do now upon cuſtom, example, education, and hence is the decay and corruption of Diſcipline, Atheiſts,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:115895:121"/> Epicures, Libertines, every one under form and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of Religion, providing immunity and impunity for their own luſts, which having ſaid, and thereby pointed with my finger to the ſore, which I cannot heal, I ſhall anſwer to the Queſtion.</p>

The ſtrait is great, where there is not a juſt and orderly power to ſeparate or ſever the precious from the vile, to deny their bread to children, or to caſt the childrens bread to dogs, and there will be found a great deal of ſelf-denial neceſſary in this caſe; The affirmative command of giving the Lords bread to his children; and the negative command of not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting pearls before ſwine, are both to be Obſerved, and the only expedient that I know is, that both Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter and people do the duty of their place, without uſurpation of further power, than they have by Gods warrant, and then all will be as well, not as it might, but as it can, as it was in <hi>Hezekiah</hi> his Paſſeover in the ſecond moneth, 2 <hi>Chron. 30. Many in the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were not ſanctified,</hi> verſ. 17. <hi>Many came out of the Tribes of Iſrael, which had not cleanſed themſelves,</hi> they did eat the Paſſeover otherwiſe than it was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <hi>verſ.</hi> 18. Here you ſee it was not ſo well as it ought, but it was as well as it could at that time, and therefore <hi>Hezekiah</hi> pray'd, <hi>The good Lord pardon every one that prepares his heart to ſeek God, though he be not according to the purification of the Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and the Lord healed the people,</hi> verſ. 20. And therefore to ſpeak more particularly to the point; I cannot counſel, but bewail the intermiſſion of the Lords Supper in ſuch Churches where there are a number of worthy Communicants, at leaſt viſibly, though there be no power of juridical excluſion of
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:115895:122"/> the unworthy. The <hi>Helvetian</hi> or <hi>Switzerland</hi> Churches claim to be Churches, and have the notes of Word and Sacraments, though this order of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline be not ſetled among them, and I am not he that ſhall blot out their name: There is an expreſſe command, <hi>Do this,</hi> and a very great obligation; There is an excellent benefit of this Ordinance, which if it ſtirre up the thirſt of Gods people to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, or rather claim it at the Miniſters hand, I ſee no ground for the refuſal: I know the Sacraments of ordinary Uſe were intermitted in the wilderneſſe, wholly or moſtly, and they were recompenſed with extraordinary, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. but that aroſe on another occaſion than this I ſpeak of; for alas, How many Churches in <hi>England,</hi> or if you will, good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in them, ſhall everlaſtingly be deprived of this high Ordinance, and the benefit of it, ſhall lie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the temptation of ſeparation, ſhall loſe this mark of a Church, and ſhall in effect be equally debarred of this Communion with Chriſt, as wicked men are, and that alſo not for any default of theirs, but for their unhappineſs of being planted in a Vineyard that wants a wall or hedge?</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>3</label> 2. A particular Church having adminiſtration of the Word and Sacraments, is not bound alwayes to want a hedge, pale or door unto the Supper of the Lord, in caſe the Civil Power is not pleaſed to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle or interpoſe in theſe affairs, but are (as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) bound to Uſe all warrantable means to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their ſociety from infection and ſcandal, and the Ordinance from undue invaſion, by giving up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſuch inſpection, as God hath entruſted it with, and themſelves have choſen, and by aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:115895:122"/> themſelves with other Churches of God, that the unity may be preſerved of the body of Chriſt, for the Arch is firm by the mutual ſupport of the ſtones, and their joyning to the top-ſtone; For the Church is a body or ſociety with which God hath depoſited his Ordinances, and given it power to meet and aſſemble themſelves together for perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of them, and it were a wonder that they ſhould not have a power of exerciſing them in a right manner.</p>
               <p>I do not arrogate unto the Church any the leaſt power of outward force or coercion, for that belongs to him that bears the Sword, who if he do not give effect to the cenſures of the Church, yet they have their effect by the conſent of the Church it ſelf, <hi>Ex Diſciplina confederata,</hi> as they ſay, which is that by which he that conſents to be of that body is ſubject to the Laws and Rules of it, and is cut off, if he prove a rotten member. To give light to this point, How ſtood the Diſcipline of Synagogues, from which I am apt to think our Chriſtian Churches took much of their pattern? They had a power to diſcommon their own members, and it ſeems to me that their <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or agreement among themſelves was that which gave effect to their cenſures, <hi>Joh</hi> 9. 22. And what is the government of Colledges, Corporations and petty Courts in Countrey-villages, where the by-Laws and amerciaments and penalties are by agreement, north warting the municipal Laws of the Commonwealth: He that will enjoy the priviledges and freedoms of ſuch a body, muſt be ſubject to the Rules and Laws of that ſociety; and ſo the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Churches under Heathen Emperours could do no
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:115895:123"/> more but disfranchize their own members from the priviledges of the Church, of which body they had by their own conſent come in to be members, and ſo ſubmitted themſelves to them. The Emperours gave not this power to the Church, but God who gave them his great Charter to be a City and Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his own, did <hi>eo ipſo,</hi> give them this power, without which they might be a <hi>Cyclops</hi> den, or chaos, but not a regular Society; And upon this ground (as I conceive) the Apoſtle reproves the <hi>Corinthians, 1 Cor. 6. &amp; 1 Cor.</hi> 5. for not doing thoſe things to prevent ſcandal, which they were impowred and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to have done as a Church of Chriſtians: And if any man had been of ſuch ſtomack or diſpoſition in thoſe times, as not to have cared a ſtraw for thoſe Church-cenſures, ſo long as the Civil power toucht him not in purſe, body, liberty, it was enough to proclaim him fitter for to be a Heathen than a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian; For it's admirable to conſider, as it is moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, That a Church cenſure, a Suſpenſion from the Communion of the Church wrought more ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and trouble, and heart-breaking, than the fire and faggot of the perſecution: In concluſion and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the whole matter, as he ſaid of the <hi>Romans,</hi> they muſt <hi>redire ad caſas,</hi> return to their poor ſhepherd cottages again: So I ſay, that in caſe of this neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, when the Civil power contributes not aſſiſtance or furtherance to the Church, ſhe muſt conſider the caſe of the primitive Churches, and what intrinſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally belongs to her to do, as a corporation or body of Gods making, with no other power of ſelf preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation from ſcandals of members, but purging them out, nor from injuries of forreiners, but ſuffering.</p>
               <p>

                  <pb n="229" facs="tcp:115895:123"/>3. Every particular member of the Church ought to withdraw or refrain from ſuch converſation with a ſcandalous brother, as may either give occaſion of ſcandal to others, or infection to himſelf. The Apoſtle allows civil commerce or entercourſe with Heathens and Infidels, if we live among them, and the bonds of natural and civil relations or duties muſt not be violated on pretence of Chriſtianity, but an arbitrary, familiar and intimate ſociety or fellowſhip with them that live or act ſcandalouſly, doth but ſoil our ſelves, harden them, offend ſober Chriſtians. It's a caution much inculcate in Scripture, <hi>Withdraw from every brother that walks diſorderly,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 3. 6. <hi>Have no company with them, that they may be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,</hi> verſ. 14. <hi>Turn away from ſuch wicked formaliſts as have no power of godlineſſe, and under the form of it are ſo wicked,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 5. <hi>With a brother that's ſcandalous, no not to eat,</hi> 1 Cor. 5. 9, 12, <hi>Them that caUſe diviſions and ſcandals mark, and avoid them, Rom.</hi> 16. 17. Theſe, and the like expreſſions ſome Learned men draw into conſequence, to prove that which we know rather the name of, than the nature of the thing, Excommunication: Others underſtood <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Grot.</hi> do Imp. p. 231.</note> by them <hi>Nullum actum privato majorem,</hi> no act great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than private avoidance of company, which is that I now ſpeak of; For in the primitive times, when the Heathens Obſerved of Chriſtians, how they lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved each other, and when the Chriſtians, had in Uſe certain remarkable teſtifications of this love, by their feaſts of love, and holy kiſſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It was a mark or note of reproof and ſhame to be ſhunned and avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the brethren, for ſcandalous ſinne, and it was medicinal to him that was ſo avoided, and in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:115895:124"/> a duty in conſcience and charity to be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and I would that all diſtances created amongſt brethren by paſſion and envy were reduced to this, then we ſhould finde, that though we had not power to ſeparate an offendor from the Church, yet the ſeparating of our ſelves from him, would work much good, and be in ſome meaſure an Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; For it is certain, that a great part of the effect thereof lies in the <hi>non</hi> Communion or withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the people from him that's ſcandalous; and as certain, that if we flatter and encourage the ſinnes of men by our ſamiliarity and fellowſhip, Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication it ſelf would be but a loſt Ordinance, and of no effect; For it is my opinion, That if Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, greater and leſſer, as they are called was in full proportion reduced into practice, yet except the people that are members of the Church did make conſcience of imparting their fellowſhip to ſuch as were cut off, it would be little better then a wooden dagger, and rather ſerve to create paſſion and fury than humility and ſhame in them.</p>

<pb n="237" facs="tcp:115895:127"/> that ſhould affirm all theſe, though newly baptized to be truly regenerate, were very wide of the truth; for there are many reputative members that are in the viſible Society and fellowſhip of the Church and it's Ordinances, that are but Jews outwardly, and they are, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>no Jews,</hi> and yet they are cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed and eat the Paſſeover, and communicate in Ordinances, and (if we will not be captious in words) are true members of the viſible Society, yet no mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſts myſtical Body, nor yet can they be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſt by us of their right unto Ordinances; for we have no judgement of their ſpiritual and inward Eſtates, nor any Command, nor any Rule to diſpoſſeſſe them, nor any example of God himſelf, who lets the corn and chaff lie together <hi>in area,</hi> and ſeparates them locally <hi>in horreo,</hi> as <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaks; and this body howſoever conſiſting of members <hi>he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terogeneall,</hi> yet being taken together in groſſe or in the lump, hath very ſublime and honourable compella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, both in the Old Teſtament, <hi>A holy Nation, a</hi>

<pb n="238" facs="tcp:115895:128"/> more eaſily finde in the world a body that hath never a frecken or ſpot, than a Church without corruption, and yet both a body and a Church be beautifull for all that. The Scripture gives us a perfect delineation of the Church, as it ought to be in Rules of faith and holineſſe, but yet ſhews us plainly, that it being Gods pleaſure, that the Net ſhould gather both good and bad, and the ſervants inviting to the marriage did bring in both good and bad; it muſt needs be conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, that many of thoſe that are called are not cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, <hi>That all that are of Iſrael, are not Iſrael.</hi> Had not this mixture ſerved more to Gods glory, even the glory of his inwardly diſcriminating grace, it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it had not been: So that as they ſay of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, Greek, Latine, theſe Languages may be pure in books, but hardly to be found purely ſpoken by any Nation now in the world, ſo are the rules of faith and life pure and perfect in the Word, and yet not ſo perfectly Obſerved by the viſible Church. And if a man ſuppoſe that a number or Colony of really holy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons might be pickt out of the Churches, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body themſelves into a Church, Are they ſure this would be anſwerable to their fancy? Did not the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> dream ſo of themſelves? And what may one think of their children in time? Doth not the pureſt ſeed we ſow come up with ſtraw and chaff? If they hold Communion with the viſible Church, Is it not all one? If they do not, Is it not worſe and more clearly without warrant?</p>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>5</label> The Church may be corrupted many wayes in Doctrine, Ordinances, Worſhip, and this I account the worſt, becaUſe it is the corruption of the beſt, as the corruption of bloud that runnes thorow all the
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:115895:128"/> body, the poiſoning of Springs and Rivers that run thorow a Nation, is worſe than a ſore finger in the body, or a ground of thiſtles in the Nation, and there are degrees of this corruption, the Doctrine in ſome remote points, hay and ſtubble upon the foundation, the Worſhip in ſome rituals or rites of mens inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or cuſtom. How many Scripture Churches do ye finde thus corrupted, and yet no Separation of Chriſt from the Jewiſh Church, nor any command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the godly of <hi>Corinth,</hi> in the Provinces of <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> or thoſe of <hi>Aſia</hi> in the <hi>Revelation?</hi> I muſt in ſuch caſe avoid the corruption, hold the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Hear them in <hi>Moſes</hi> chair, and yet beware of their leaven; but if corruptions invade the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, the foundation of Doctrine is deſtroyed, the worſhip is become idolatrous, the leproſie is gotten into the wals and ſubſtance of the hoUſe, and which is above all, If the Church impoſe ſuch Laws of their Communion, as there is neceſſity of doing or approving things unlawfull, or I am ruin'd and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, then muſt I either break with God or men, and in that caſe, <hi>Come out of Babylon:</hi> The Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of Proteſtants ſo ſeparated from them of <hi>Rome;</hi> it was a neceſſary and juſt Separation, the Lawes of their Communion were ruinous to the ſoul, if we hold it; to the body and life, if we held it not. </p>

And yet I would not be miſtaken by the ſimpleſt man, as if I accounted it ſeparation, if a Chriſtian hear a Sermon, or receive the Sacrament in another Congregation; For he that takes a meal at another Table doth not thereby ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from his own hoUſe; or if a Chriſtian at liberty to diſpoſe his dwelling, ſhall remove and ſit down under more fruitfull Ordinances; I account not this ſeceſſion a Separation, no more than if being ſickly, and having not health in the City, he remove his ſeat into the Countrey for purer air, becaUſe in ſo doing he removes from the City, but renounces not his freedom therein, nor diſclaims in like proportion the Communion of the Church.</p>

                  <p>The Separation of the Church from wicked men and infidels, by Gods calling and Covenant with it, is as neceſſary as the profeſſion of faith and holineſſe.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>1</label> THe third Queſtion is, <hi>Whether the Sacrament of the Lords Supper be a converting Ordinance?</hi> There is a converſion of a regenerate man, from ſome <note place="margin">Luk. 22. 32.</note> fall or ſinne, as in that ſaying, <hi>When thou art convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtrengthen thy brethren,</hi> and ſo a man that's god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly may be often converted, that is, raiſed up from la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pſes and backſlidings. Of this the Queſtion is not; for this is but as the blowing in of the candle, when the flame is gone out, by exciting or wakening the fire that yet glows in the weeck of the candle, which may be done by this Sacrament; But the Queſtion is, Whether God doth offer or exhibit the firſt grace, for converſion of an unbeliever or unregenerate man; for as <hi>Davenant</hi> rightly ſaith, <hi>The firſt faith muſt be given to an unbeliever, as the first light is that which comes into meer darkneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Queſtion is but an upſtart among us, which hath riſen on occaſion of ſecluſion of ſome from this Sacrament, and indeed quite overthrows it, if the Sacrament be a converting Ordinance; for upon this ground we may invite the moſt wicked to the
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:115895:133"/> Table, as well as to the Word, namely for converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and it were a great ſin to prohibit any from the appointed means of their converſion.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>2</label> For anſwer to the Queſtion, I premiſe, </p>
               <p>That, it is the Doctrine of <hi>Whitaker,</hi> that as the Word is the mean and inſtrument of grace, ſo is the Sacrament, in general, the one is applied to the ear, the other to the eye; This is the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, The Word begins and works grace in the heart (<hi>For faith comes by hearing</hi>) but the Sacrament is objected to the eye, and doth not begin the work of grace, but nouriſhes and incReaſes it, for faith is not begotten by the Sacraments, but only augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Thus he. The Doctrine of phyſical operation is exploded by all the orthodox, Sacraments do not work grace, as a plaiſter cures a ſore, that's a blinde conceit of ignorant ſouls, but God by them, or in their Uſe imparts grace, as he did healing by the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen Serpent. Now God by Baptiſm ſolemnly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents and ſeals to his people their planting into Chriſt, <hi>We are planted by Baptiſme into the likeneſse of his death,</hi> Rom. 6. 3, 4, 5. <hi>And by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 13. and therefore Baptiſm is called, the Sacrament of our implanting, ingraffing, incorporating into Chriſt, and ſo is a Sacrament of initiation, <hi>Ye are all children of God by faith in Christ; For as many of you as have been baptized into Chriſt, have put on Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 3. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. God was pleaſed to have his Covenant ſealed by Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm, as to the firſt grace of that Covenant, as by Circumciſion alſo under the Law, and ſo we are ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly liſted and admitted to be his, and called by his name; But then as to the grace of education of
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:115895:133"/> his children up unto maturity and ripeneſſe by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming them, and ſtrengthning and cauſing them to grow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He hath ordained another Sacrament, which is called the ſecond, becaUſe it preſuppoſes the firſt, as Paſſeover did Circumciſion, and that is the Lords Supper, of which learned <hi>Hooker</hi> ſaith, <hi>The grace</hi>

I need not number Authours or Churches. It is ſo plain a caſe, that I wonder they that have ſtood up in defence of it as a converting Ordinance, have not taken notice of it; There is an Army to a man againſt them, and the ancient Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Churches are ſo clear in it, that they admitted no convert from the Heathen to either Baptiſm or Supper, till they had teſtified their faith and repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, nor were they called <hi>fideles,</hi> till they were ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized and admitted to the Supper, whatſoever knowledge, faith or repentance ſo ever they ſhowed before.</p>
               <p>Let me firſt clear the ſtate of the Queſtion, and then give you the Reaſons.</p>
               <p>For the firſt.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I do not deny that a man having ſome know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:115895:134"/> of the Goſpel, and viſibly profeſſing it (for I do not think that any doth imagine that the very pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the elements into a meer Heathens mouth may convert him) may be truly and really converted at the Sacrament, for who ſhall lock up the hands of the Spirit, ſo as the Laver of Regeneration, and the renewing of the holy Ghoſt? <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5. The work of the Lord, and a mans eating and drinking may not be together; Or do we think that this time and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion are incompoſſible? No, I think not ſo: Nor do I Queſtion or doubt that the Word of God adjoyned to the Sacrament, it being accompanied with the Goſpel-promiſes, and the lively painting forth of Chriſt may not work coverſion, for why the word out of a Pulpit, and the word at a Table, or in any other place, ſhould not have this ſame effect, I ſee not; You will ſay, This is the cloathed Uſe of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, the adminiſtration being accompanied with the Word, and ſo ſtill it is the Word that converts. But what will you ſay to the naked Uſe and applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſignes, that is, the act of diſtribution, <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, Eating, Drinking,</hi> Do theſe convert or confer the firſt grace? I anſwer, I am not curious in deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the very nick of time of mans converſion, I affirm not, that ſo it is, nor deny that ſo it may be, <hi>The winde blows when and where it liſteth.</hi> This yet is not the Queſtion; <q rend="margQuotes">"But whether there be found any declared intention, any inſtitution and appointment of God, that this Ordinance ſhall convert ſouls, or hath made it apt for that purpoſe, ſo as we may look for ſuch efficacy from it by vertue of Gods inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof to this end?</q> For it is a meerly poſitive Ordinance, and the effect or efficiency muſt be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted

But doth it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low hence, that therefore all may come, be invited, or admitted, becaUſe we ſay that which God can do, not what he hath promiſed or declared that he will? <hi>Prater</hi> intentional or accidental effects give no ground to ſeek them at ſuch a caUſe as is not ordained to work them, though haply ſome have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted at that time. Muſt a man that ſeeks a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom be ſent to ſeek his fathers Aſſes, becaUſe <hi>Saul</hi> heard ſuch news at ſuch a time? Muſt we run a man thorow with a ſword to ſave his life, becaUſe one did ſo once, and let out a ſecret impoſtume? BecaUſe ſome Miniſter hath been converted at his Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Is therefore the laying on of hands inſtituted for that purpoſe? BecaUſe a man hath been converted at his marriage, where the Sermon and benediction have wrought on him: Is therefore marriage a conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Ordinance?

               <pb n="252" facs="tcp:115895:135"/>
               <p>Secondly, There is difference to be made between the qualifications of a man to his admittance to this Sacrament, and the qualifications of him unto the inward grace, benefit, or effect of it: If one be a baptized perſon, a knowing profeſſour of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, againſt whom there lies no barre of notorious ignorance or ſcandal, though it appear not that he is truly regenerate and ſincere in grace, yet he hath ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance, he claims upon ſuch a right, as the Church cannot juſtly diſallow, no more than an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> circumciſed and clean could be debarred the Paſſeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; but as to the effect and benefit of the Supper to his ſoul, there is required more than ſo, even true faith in Chriſt, and regeneration, that he may exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe ſuch graces as the benefits are promiſed unto, and come to the Seals of the Covenant with the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Covenant; The wiſe Virgins cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid the fooliſh from waiting with them, for they have lamps as well as they, but the Lord ſhuts the door againſt them from entring in with him, for their oyl was out. Glory not in this, that the Church ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits you to the Table, but labour for the grace to feed upon the dainties ſet upon it, many have the liberty to Uſe it, that have not the benefit or ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of that Uſe; many have a hundred times taſted bread and wine, that never once taſted the body and bloud of Chriſt.</p>

It is a more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Ordinance, and preſuppoſes ſome foundation laid by the Word, that it may have effect; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting Ordinance muſt go before the confirming; the qualifications of a receiver are not the ſame with the neceſſary qualifications of a hearer; and (which I conceive Divines mean in part by requiring Baptiſm before the Supper) the grace properly ſealed in Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme is neceſſary to the obtainment of that grace which is properly ſealed in the Supper; As Chriſt waſht his Diſciples feet before he celebrated and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred this Sacrament. It's true, God hath ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us, that we ſhould not call any man common or unclean, as <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 28. that is, legally, or unclean by his Nation, as if the diſtance and partition wall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile</hi> was yet ſtanding, but morally unclean there are ſtill, and we may call them ſo, or elſe we muſt call evil good, and this uncleanneſs is not proper to the ſinners of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> but even <hi>Jews</hi> by nature; Chriſtians (as I may ſay) by nature are many of them unclean, wherein I would not confirm them, but endeavour to waſh them from it.</p>

<pb n="259" facs="tcp:115895:138"/> it's ſaid, <hi>That this bread we break, This Cup we bleſſe is the Communion of the body and bloud of Chriſt;</hi> And what is that but participation? For as <hi>Chemnitius</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, <note place="margin">

Now this is that which is ſealed to a believer; and of it ſelf though no man believe it, ſeals (as was ſaid before) the truth and reality of the Promiſe, and of Gods offer; for I ſhall not deny that.

No: It's true, the ſame life in a dead man would make him live, but the life maintain'd in a man by meat and drink is therefore maintain'd, becaUſe there is a life in the man that can eat and drink, receive nouriſhment, by which the meat is made nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and lively, which otherwiſe could not be; And ſo there muſt be life in the Patient, elſe the Plaiſter or Medicine, if applied to a dead man, would not recover or ſtrengthen life: I deny not but if the Sacrament could convey the ſame grace to a dead man, as it doth to a living, that dead man would live, but that it cannot doe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caUſe it works by way of nouriſhment, which the dead receive not.</p>

               <p n="1">1. That theſe words referre to the manner of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating, and conſequently to the act, or actual receiving of the Sacrament; and therefore the Text ſaith, <hi>He that eats and drinks unworthily,</hi> theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbial expreſſions denote the mode or manner of the act, and cannot be applied to any man out of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry act.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That yet they connote ſome aptitude, or inap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, ſome fitneſſe or unfitneſſe of the perſon from whence this manner of the action doth proceed, as acts referre to ſome habit or diſpoſition, whence they ariſe, and ſo we call a worthy or unworthy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municant, one that hath or wants ſuch qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or ſuch frame of ſpirit as is apt to bring forth ſutable actions, and theſe qualifications deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate the perſon antecedaneous to the act, as we call a valiant man, before we fight; a worthy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municant, though not in the act; we need no place

               <p n="3">3. That howſoever in our Engliſh Uſe, and ſo in the Latine, we mean by worthineſſe and unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſome perſon or action, an extraordinary per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection or excellency, or an extraordinary poorneſſe and baſeneſſe, yet here the words muſt be interpreted relatively, that is, in relation to the Ordinance, and ſo they import no more then fitly, condecently, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerably, becomingly, or contrarily. If the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of eating or drinking be anſwerable to, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming of the Ordinance, being ſuch as the exigence and nature thereof doth demand or beſpeak of us, then we receive it worthily; for as you cannot tell, whether a man act a part well, unleſſe you know what part it is, the <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>I have recommended to you the ſenſe and meaning of the words, and before I go further will infer from

<pb n="266" facs="tcp:115895:142"/> it prevail'd not at firſt for removal of the thorn, nor with God neither, but he had his eye open'd to ſee the Uſe of that thorn, like a corroſive to eat away the proud fleſh growing, and that contented him, the ſtay of the thorn was anſwer to his prayer, when he ſaw the Uſe of it, and was ſupported under it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 8. We look for Gods anſwer to us in our prayer, or in his Ordinance, as that man that lookt for the Sunne riſing towards the Eaſt, whereas he that looked Weſt-ward for it on the top of the high Tower or Steeple, ſaw it firſt: To ſee and to have the Uſe of a ſinne or corruption, is a better anſwer of an Ordinance many times, than to be quit of it; For (as <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaies) <hi>Proud hearts have need of ſinnes as proud ſores of eating plaiſters;</hi> And therefore to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer this point nearer home, and nearer the caſe it ſelf. The Apoſtles that were near Chriſt at this firſt Sacrament, within few hours after it betray'd their weakneſſe, they fled from him, they hid themſelves, and the ſtrongeſt of them took the greateſt fall; Shall we ſay they communicated unworthily, becaUſe the ſucceſſe was ſo bad? No, for we muſt not meaſure altogether by that Rule, but by the manner of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; if ſuch graces and affections be then ſet on work, as the Ordinance doth beſpeak; It's well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that the recording of the ſinnes of holy men in Scripture, is as profitable and Uſefull to the Church, as the record of their graces or heroical acts; For as we look upon their graces, we are aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of our ſelves, and inſtructed to imitation, as we look on their ſinnes and failings, we are not diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged unto deſperation, and the Scripture it ſelf di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects us to ſome ſuch like Uſe, <hi>Jam. 5. 17. Elias was a
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:115895:142"/> man ſubject to like paſsions as we are,</hi> viz. <hi>to like afflictions,</hi> and to like fruit trees. It's Gods part of the Covenant to finiſh our faith and ſupport our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to revive our ſpirits, and ſubdue our corruptions. It's our part to believe and walk humbly with God, not only in our converſation, but the Uſe of his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances; Let us minde our own part, and take com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in the acting of grace at leaſt, if we have not the deſired benefit and fruit of Ordinances to comfort us; For were I to chUſe, I had rather exerciſe grace in my communion with God, than enjoy a ſenſible ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture; I ſpeak it to improve a Chriſtian in his graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous actings, though I know withall that at laſt the fruit will fall into his boſom; for he that goes out weeping, and bears precious ſeed, ſhall doubtleſſe come again with joy, and bring his ſheaves, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 126. 6. And again, <hi>Hoſea 6. 2. After two dayes he will revive us,</hi> in the third (as Chriſt was raiſed) he will raiſe us up, then ſhall we know, if we follow on to know the Lord; in the mean time before this fruit be ripe, the very running of the ſap is a certain ſigne the Tree lives. And ſo I have given you a meaſure or rule of judging, whether you receive wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Think not that the Sacrament conveyes or contributes any thing to you as a medicinal potion or plaiſter; Doth the Phyſick work, and ſo the plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, by an inherent or inward vertue in it ſelf, not by any vertue in the Phyfician or Chyrurgeon? So ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and ſuperſtitious people look on the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they think it ſaves them, and does them good, they know not how, and ſo regard the matter more than the manner of receiving, they miſtake Gods
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:115895:143"/> manner of working by Sacraments, and therefore regard not their own manner of receiving them, and are ſo fond, as if they could eat and drink away their ſinnes, and had by very receiving this bread and wine quit all old ſcores, and were freſh to begin upon a new account, as the Papiſt thinks of his auricular confeſſion.</p>

Now I cannot poſſibly conceive, how the elementals of bread and wine, can or do any otherwiſe convey to or afford me any ſpiritual grace, but as inſtruments and means by Gods meer poſitive appointment and ordination, repreſenting, teſtifying, ſealing to me not only Gods reality of promiſe or Covenant in of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Chriſt, but my intereſt and propriety in Chriſt, and the benefits that flow from Union and Communion with Chriſt; and therefore that revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, refreſhing incReaſe of grace, power of morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of luſts, Come no otherwiſe to me by the Uſe of this Ordinance, than as it ſeals Chriſt to me, and by ſealing Chriſt or the Covenant to me doth confirm faith, revive the heart, elevate the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſtrengthen reſolutions, fortifie againſt luſts and temptations; for it is a ſure Rule, The nearer appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of Chriſt to the ſoul and his benefits in way of taſte or aſſurance, the more quickning grace of all ſorts, follows thereupon; As the nearer approach of the Sunne in the Spring, cheers up and revives all things that live, but things ſtark dead are as dead then, as in deep of winter. Let me convey this to
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:115895:143"/> you by a familiar ſimilitude; A man hath an Eſtate, the Wool, the Wine, the Corn that grows out of that Eſtate clothes him, refreſhes him, feeds him, but the Seal that confirms and aſſures this Eſtate to him, doth no otherwiſe cloath, or refreſh, or feed him, than as it confirms that eſtate to him, out of which all theſe do riſe: And by this you may plainly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand how grace is conveyed by this Sacrament, which doth ſeal up to you, and aſſure you of Chriſt, and the Covenant of promiſes in Chriſt, out of which all theſe graces grow and flow: Do ye underſtand this? Then it follows,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That for any man to imagine that the very eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drinking this bread and this Cup ſhould cure and heal his ſoul, is as fond as to think the very ſeal or wax of a Deed ſhould either ſeed or clothe him, for in that caſe it's not a ſeal, but a piece of wax, how infinitely do our common people undervalue this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, that make but a piece of holy bread of it, which is an exhibition of the body of Chriſt, as they that value a ſeal by the worth of the wax, and not by the Eſtate thereby confirmed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That it's abſolutely neceſſary to bring to this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, that grace which is neceſſary to the receiving of Chriſt himſelf, <hi>Quid paras dentem?</hi> What does the providing of teeth to eat (ſaith <hi>Auſtin</hi>) What avail is all outward preparation? The thing that is exhibited to us is Chriſt his body broken, his bloud ſhed, Chriſt dying, Chriſt a Sacrifice offer'd up to God is here commemorated, and is here offer'd, and that inward grace which is neceſſary to receive and cloſe with Chriſt, muſt be brought with you; That grace is found by and from the word, and that grace
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:115895:144"/> muſt be Uſed here, and exerciſed. The Covenant requires it, and the Seal is the Seal of the Covenant; You cannot take the Seal and leave the Covenant, you cannot enter Covenant without faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, you do but expect that the Seal ſhould ſeal a lie to you, if you expect remiſſion of ſinnes to be ſealed without your faith in Chriſt. It's impoſſible that the Word and Sacrament ſhould be oppoſite, as that the Covenant and Seal thereof ſhould diſagree. As therefore if one would know what a Seal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veys or confirms, let him reade the Deed, and the Conditions of it, and there it is learn'd, So if you would know what the Sacrament ſeals to you, hear what the Word ſaith, Mercy and Grace to a believer in Chriſt, and to no other, which he that will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from this fountain, muſt bring his veſſel with him, for <hi>qui fide vacuus, foras manducat non intus</hi>

That words of high ſound, in vulgar and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon acceptation, when they come to be undertaken in a Goſpel-ſenſe and notion, do ſhrink into a meer contemptibleneſſe with worldly wiſe men; For as the Goſpel Uſeth ſome Greek words in a ſenſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to eloquent profane Authours, ſo it hath a notion of Bleſſedneſſe, Perfection, Glory, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:115895:144"/> which reliſhes not the palate, nor bears any ſhow in the world. If <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> deſcribe bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, what a deal of humane perfection and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments of fortune doth he croud into it, for which he is derided by other Sects? But if Chriſt deſcribe bleſſedneſſe in the Goſpel, what do you hear of, but poverty of Spirit, purity of heart, meekneſſe, mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſuffering for righteouſneſſe ſake, wherein there is no more ſhew of bleſſedneſſe to a worldly man, than there was in Chriſt of Majeſty to <hi>Herod</hi> and his men of warre? So perfection in Goſpel-phraſe is a diſclaiming thereof, and ſence of our imperfection, <hi>Phil. 3. 12. And the Spirit of glory reſts upon you that ſuffer,</hi> 1 Pet. 4. 14. And your worthineſſe is rather the ſenſe of your unworthineſſe: Thus the Goſpel conſtrues theſe high ſounding words, and the Reaſon is, becaUſe the Goſpel placing our righteouſneſſe and our happineſſe in the having of Chriſt, and taking every man utterly off his own bottom, doth thereby come to a new reckoning, that is not Uſed in the whole world, and accounts them full that are moſt empty, rich that are poor, bleſſed, that are in their own ſenſe, or outward condition, miſerable, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing all things, that have nothing; and ſo in this point in hand, according to <hi>Luther</hi>'s paradoxal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, which our <hi>Whitaker</hi> approves, is <hi>Eſt optime diſpoſitus, qui eſt peſsime diſpoſitus,</hi> He is moſt worthy that is moſt unworthy, <hi>viz.</hi> that is ſenſible of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſſe.</p>

                     <hi>Whitak.</hi> de Sacram. p. 658.</note> be imagin'd to ſignifie any meritorious or proud con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruities of our vertues, works, righteouſneſſe, it would be the greateſt unworthineſſe that could be;
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:115895:145"/> What ſhould ſuch proud creatures come to a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or memorial of Chriſts death, for that being no ſinne with them to be expiated by that death? <hi>Thou ſayeſt, I am rich, I ſtand in need of nothing; go anoint thy eyes that thou mayeſt ſee,</hi> Revel. 5. This Pool of <hi>Siloam</hi> is for ſuch as have infirmities. Nor doth the Goſpel require perfect faith, or perfect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance or grace, for that's againſt the nature of this Sacrament, which is to laſt no longer than our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections and infirmities laſt, that is, untill Chriſt come. So as there is no better Argument of our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection, than the command of growing in grace, ſo neither is any a fit patient for this medicine, but the weak and impotent, the doubting and complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſoul. The Goſpel knows not the name of attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, nor the thing. <hi>Not that I have attained, or were already perfect,</hi> Phil. 3. 12. This meat and drink is for growing children, which as the old Phyſician (<hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith) muſt be often-nouriſht. How long might a man examine himſelf before he finde this temper in himſelf, that he wants nothing? there can be no wonder that ſuch a one is above Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, eſpecially this, which though it be one of the higheſt Ordinances of the Church, yet is accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated to the Uſe of the loweſt believer; The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles communicated in it before the Spirit was ſent down ſolemnly upon them, they were but ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and raw, when Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Take, Eat, Drink ye all of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. If thou haſt the ſeminals of grace mixt with a maſſe of corruptions (as gold at firſt is mixed with much earth) there may be worthineſſe, deſpiſe not ſmall things; Natural generation, begins in a ſmall

Thou canſt not ſay, thou haſt faith, but canſt thou feel thy want of it, and mourn for it? This ſmoak comes from ſome inviſible ſpark: Thou art not (thou ſayeſt) in Covenant, and the Seal belongs not to thee; But art thou willing to be in it, and come into the bond of the Lord? Is it the longing of thy ſoul to be ingaged in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ways of God, and diſenthrall'd from the ſweet bondage of ſin? In a word, Let thy ſins and corruptions be ſtrong and violent, thy wants many, thy weakneſſe great: Let them be as thou ſayeſt, as thou feareſt, yet if there be a groaning ſenſe, a longing deſire of reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, affections piercing of, and breathing after Chriſt; If there be a ſeed of God in thy heart, which is kept alive in the midſt of ſo much corruption, by no leſſe a miracle than if a ſpark be kept alive in the ſea, then ſurely there is a Goſpel-meetneſſe in thee to be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of this Supper; Here is Chriſt cook'd ready to thy weakeſt and loweſt faith in obvious materials of meat and drink: Let not the pride of any worthineſſe bring thee, nor the ſenſe of unworthineſſe keep thee back.</p>

Let me ſpeak freely to you, we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt loſt that reverence, devotion, gravity, decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy which formerly and anciently adorned the publick Ordinances and Adminiſtrations, and our experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence may teach us, that while we decline the extream of curioſity, ſuperſtition, pomp and ſtarelineſſe, we incline to the other of irreverence, profaneneſſe, looſneſſe, ſordidneſſe; While we talk of worſhipping God in Spirit and Truth, we exempt our bodies from adoration, and both forget that our bodies are part of Chriſts purchaſe, and the Rule that is infer'd thereupon, <hi>Glorifie therefore God in your body and in your ſpirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 20. For doe we not prophane our eyes by wandring, our tongues by talking, our faces by laughing, and the Ordinance of God by all?

I ſhall ſhew you in the next, That the exerciſe of grace is requiſite unto the act of receiving worthily, but it is the having of that grace, whereby a man ſhall try and judge of his fitneſſe to come; For (I ſuppoſe) firſt, that there is ſome previous diſpoſition or quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, which gives capacity or meetneſſe to come to this Table, as the word, <hi>Let a man examine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſo let him come,</hi> doth clearly prove, and then that this fitneſſe or habitual qualification is the having or exciting of thoſe graces which are to be exerciſed and ſet a work; As a ſouldier is accoutred
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:115895:148"/> and furniſht with ſuch weapons, as in fight are to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed and Uſed, and therefore a Chriſtian that would try or know his own fitneſſe or worthineſſe, confiders firſt what graces are to be ſet on work in the act of receiving, and then examines whether he have them before-hand or no: Plain ſenſe and Reaſon ſhews, that a dead man is not fit to eat and drink, becaUſe he cannot exerciſe any act of life, without which he neither eats nor can be refreſht, and therefore we muſt conclude, that there is an habitual fitneſſe required to be in the perſon that communicates wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily.</p>

I have no warrant to ſet the mark ſo high, that the leaſt of Gods children qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified, ſhould not reach it; for I confider, that this Sacrament was ordained for the Church, during the eſtate of imperfection, and for remedy of weakneſſe and infirmity, not like the Tree of Life, which man was debarred from, for his ſinne in the forbidden fruit; and as <hi>Luther</hi> ſaid, <hi>A childe may receive a Ring as well as a Gyant, and the leaſt Candle points upwards as well as the greateſt Torch.</hi> Great Maſters of Families (as the Prodigal Obſerved) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the meaneſt of their domeſtick ſervants to come to the Tables end, and eat of their bread.

<pb n="281" facs="tcp:115895:149"/> full; A broken Chriſt requires a broken heart: To be rich, and full, and righteous in the Goſpel-Dictionary, doe ſignifie Obſtructions, and impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our happineſſe; where the naked are cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the hungry are fed, the ungodly are juſtified, the weary are refreſht, the ſick are healed, the ſtung with fiery Serpents are recovered, the returning loſt childe is feaſted, and they that thirſt <hi>do buy wine and milk without money and without price;</hi> And hence it follows,</p>
                  <p>That no unregenerate man that lies dead in tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaſſes and ſinnes, without a ſeed, a ſpark of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-grace, having no initials of true Repentance and Faith in Chriſt, can be in capacity to eat and drink the Body and Bloud of Chriſt worthily, and with effect, for ſuch a one is a ſtranger to the Covenant, and uncircumciſed, and therefore expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly debar'd this Paſſeover, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 43. Where there is no life there can be no reception of nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment.

The activity and imploiment of our faith and affections is now required, and our graces muſt be on their wheels; now the ſails are ſpread to catch the gale which ſweetly breathes from this holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, for here it's ſaid, <hi>Take, Eat, Take and drink;</hi> and as the eye, the hand, the mouth are now in actual imploiment, as to the Sacrament, or outward part, ſo faith which is the eye, hand, mouth of the ſoul, and all the affections are to be actually imploy'd, as to the inward thing, the body and bloud of Chriſt; Not the having of an eye, but looking up to the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen Serpent healed the biting. It's not enough to have faith, but we muſt believe. Now that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is in Uſe, now muſt our graces be in Uſe too. Now that God actually offers and preſents Chriſts body and bloud to my faith; Now let the hand of faith go forth and take Chriſt in.

Alas, if my graces be now aſleep, they are next a kin to dead; We might have ſweet, we might have fruitfull Sacraments had we but lively graces; Graces upon their wing, not lying ſullen, and benum'd with cold, therefore blow up your graces, as the Apoſtle his phraſe is, blow the ſmothering fire, the embers into a flame by pertinent meditation; <hi>Be ye lift up ye everlaſting doors, that this King of glory may come in;</hi> And that I may ſpeak to the comfort of a godly ſoul, Let grace run forth at what tap it will, ſo there be but vent, whether at the uppermoſt of high praiſes, or at the lower of melting humblings; If the fire flame, riſe high, thou haſt more comfort; If it ſmoak, God will not quench-it, and that's ſome comfort: Some have a finer taſte, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh their meat with higher guſt and more delight than others, and yet others be nouriſht as well, as much as they; So haply ſome receive Chriſt with greater delectation, and yet thy ſoul may be nouriſht as well as theirs.</p>

                  <hi>That a man who is in a ſtate of grace, and ſo god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, may yet receive the Lords Supper unworthily, and without effect, not for want of habitual fitneſſe or qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification, but for want of the actual exerciſe of grace at preſent, or becaUſe of ſome diſtempers which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take and ſurpriſe him in the act of communicating.</hi> This Point it may be at firſt ſight looks ſtrangely, but upon conſideration will be found too true; For if we look back to the Paſſeover, we finde, that an <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelite</hi> circumciſed, and ſo qualified to eat the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, yea a true <hi>Iſraelite</hi> might be unclean at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent time, and ſo uncapable of keeping it; And we have at home in this Text, an example and a proof of this Point. Theſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> are looked upon as, and ſuppoſed to be (and no doubt ſome of them were)
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:115895:152"/> godly and regenerate perſons, who yet contracted epidemical judgements upon them, <hi>Many ſick, weak, &amp;c.</hi> and that for a ſinne they little thought of, their undue and unfit coming to the Lords Table; they are diſtinguiſht from the world, <hi>verſ. 32, Of whom its ſaid, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, verſ. 30. For this caUſe you are judged of the Lord, and chaſtened;</hi> and hence the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is contended to import only temporal judgement in this place. I confeſſe this Point is controverted and diſputed, and more abroad than at home amongſt us. <hi>Vaſquez</hi> ſeems to me to hold, That it is enough that a man be in a ſtate of grace, and that every godly man receives worthily, or elſe ſhould ſinne mortally; But it is no new Doctrine with us, That a regenerate man may ſinne mortally (as they ſpeak) or commit a ſinne meritorious of condemnation; We muſt not leſſen regenerate mens ſinnes, which in divers reſpects are the greater, becaUſe the perſon is regenerate; Even they that are babes in Chriſt, may be-carnal, and walk as men, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 3. And therefore <hi>Cajetan</hi> on the other ſide requires actual Devotion, as neceſſary to the fruit of this Sacrament; and his Argument is, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caUſe the Sacrament works according to the manner of its ſignification; And therefore as meat and drink to the end they may nouriſh, do require that we coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate by ſome act of life, to receive and digeſt them; ſo there is neceſſary ſome act of inward grace to meet with and receive this ſpiritual food, that it may nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh and refreſh us; and I hold the Argument good and firm; Nor do I finde any priviledge of a regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate man, that he cannot commit this ſinne: He may be under a ſpiritual Apoplexy or ſtupidity, as
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:115895:152"/> 
                  <hi>David</hi> for a time ſeems to have been: He may be overgrown with a cruſt, a coldneſſe, a ſecurity, and ſo unfit by diſeaſe, though not by death. <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome</hi> ſaw this truth, when he ſpeaks of ſome that may not eat, becaUſe not initiated, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and others, though they be members, yet are <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, unclean. It's true, It is proper to the godly to receive worthily, but it's proper, <hi>Soli ſed non ſemper,</hi> only they do ſo, but not they alwayes, and therefore I turn my ſpeech to you, and deſire that you be not render'd ſecure and negligent by this falſe principle, that a regenerate man cannot receive the Sacrament unworthily, for this is the ready way to fall into that ſinne which you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine your ſelves free from, by taking you off from that ſelf-examination, that trimming of your Lamps, that purging out of the old Leaven, that blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of your Graces into act, which is ſo requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite unto your meeting with your Lord in this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance.</p>
               <p>I know that for the moſt part thoſe do charge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with this ſinne of receiving unworthily, that have leaſt caUſe; The worthieſt Communicants are to their own eye the worſt; They never acted their graces lively at the Sacrament; They never felt the preſent delights and fatneſſe of this Ordinance; They have been alwayes incumbred with doubts, with fears and diſtempers, and have often gone away with more anguiſh of ſpirit than they came, and a world of ſuch complaints there are; and I confeſſe it is not ordinary that gracious perſons do ſtand in good opinion with themſelves, but yet <hi>Jacobs</hi> going away halting from God, was not an argument that
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:115895:153"/> he had not prevail'd; Sick people may be nouriſht and ſtrengthen'd with that meat which they cannot taſte or reliſh in their mouth; Grace is more apt to ſee ſinne than it ſelf; for the eye doth not ſee it ſelf, and the more it grows in light, the more tender in ſenſe: In ſpirituals it is true: But I ſhall ſpeak a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, Thoſe diſeaſes we feel and are ſick of, ſeldome prove mortal, that is, when the affections melt with ſorrow, and not the conſcience amazed with horrour, though I would not nouriſh complaints againſt my ſelf, yet I had rather have the ſenſe of <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 7. wherein he complains of himſelf, than his confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, when he ſaid, <hi>I verily thought I ought to do, &amp;c.</hi> and I think a proud confidence both a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er caUſe and ſigne of unworthy receiving, than humble fear and ſenſe of imperfection, for even this is a grace to be exerciſed at the Lords Table.</p>

So as if you tell me of any ſenſible object, it's eaſie to ſhew what ſenſe it belongs unto, for if it be light or colour, it belongs to the eye, if it be any ſound, it belongs to the ear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So this Sacrament being ſurvey'd and ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it is not hard to finde what graces are to be ſet on work accordingly: And this Rule, that I may not gueſſe at randome, I ſhall follow in the enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It's neceſſary that the Communicant have knowledge of the Nature, Uſe, and End of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and that is demonſtrate thus: Here are out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward elements and actions, which do ſignifie ſome other thing, as namely, the body and bloud of Chriſt, as himſelf expounds it, offer'd by God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and to be received by the Communicant, and therefore there muſt be knowledge to diſcern and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand this myſtery that's hidden under a viſible out-ſide, to wit, the Sacrifice of Chriſts body, which is repreſented, and the confirmation of the Goſpel-Covenant by his bloud; for without this knowledge a man comes blinde-fold, eats and drinks as a bruit, takes the diſh for the meat, and is no otherwiſe refreſht than a thirſty man would be by eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſucking a ſign-poſt, which doth but ſignifie that there is wine within.

                  <hi>Exod. 12. 26. What mean you by this ſervice?</hi> And I would our ignorant people would ſo play the childe, for they do but eat the ſhell, and gnaw the bone of the outward ſervice, becaUſe they know not the meaning of it; So the carnall Jew knew not the meaning of the Rites and Types then Uſed, nor ſaw both Law and Goſpel in their Sacrifices, both which they were full of; I confeſſe the knowledge of this Sacrament draws with it the knowledge of our loſt eſtate, (as Paſſeover is not underſtood without <hi>Egypt</hi>) in ſinne and miſery; For where Chriſt appears blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, there ſinne muſt needs appear deadly, and thoſe fundamentals and grounds of Chriſtianity, which are but the <hi>A.

Whoſoever ſee the Sonne, and believes in him, ſhall have everlaſting life.</hi> I ſhould not charge a poor Chriſtian with any great rate of knowledge, for the quality is more to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded than the quantity; If he know both ſinne and Chriſt by taſte, as well as by ſight, if he have a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing and favoury knowledge of the things of the Spirit, and there be, as it is in embers, a great heat, though but little light, then is it good, though not great. I know that Queſtions <hi>demodo</hi> in all points of Divinity are hard to anſwer. It's well if we can anſwer a Queſtion <hi>aere.</hi> I may know what ſinne is,

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>3</label> Secondly, This is not all, but it is firſt, as light was at the Creation, the firſt creature, but all the world was not made when light was; He is not wholly fitted that hath knowledge, there muſt be a Chriſt-receiving, or a Chriſt-taking faith, and this is ſhown thus, God offers the body and bloud of his Sonne, which was ſhed for the remiſſion of ſinne, and ſaith, <hi>Take ye, Eat ye, Drink ye,</hi> and that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward act, which anſwers to this outward action, whereby we do receive Chriſt that is exhibited we call faith; when Chriſt is tender'd to us in the Word, we believe <hi>ex-promiſſo;</hi> when offer'd in the Supper, we believe <hi>ex pignore;</hi> There we have a promiſe, here a pawn or pledge: This faith is the taking hand, which goes forth to the offering-hand of God. This taking, eating, drinking, are but faith appropriating and applying Chriſt: You ſay, you believe, What believe you? That God offers Chriſt to your faith; What's a poor man the richer for believing that one offers him a ſhilling? What's a condemned man the better for believing that a pardon is offer'd to him? This is but a faith of the truth of the offer; But doe ye receive Chriſt offered? Do you cloſe in with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Chriſt? Do you take him into you? Here is the beſt Covenant, ſealed with the beſt blood that ever was; You believe this to be a truth, but come not in to this Covenant, that ſaith doth but ſerve to your juſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation;
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:115895:156"/> It is the Chriſt-receiving, not the truth acknowledging ſaith that brings ſalvation to you. If men did but know what ſaving ſaith is, we ſhould have either more or fewer believers, more, for they would renounce that ſuperficial thing cahed faith, and <hi>buy gold tried in the fire;</hi> Fewer, for they would not count themſelves to believe by that faith which they have; A woman may believe a man to be rich and honourable, and reall in his ſuit, yet that belief doth not make a marriage, but actual conſent to take him for a husband; For ſaith gives as well as takes, it gives a man up to Chriſt, as well as takes Chriſt to be a Saviour. It is not true faith that blows hot and cold out of the ſame mouth, and cries <hi>Hoſanna</hi> to Chriſt a Saviour, but yet I will not have him reigne over me: This Sacrament preſents Chriſt to faith thus, It preſents Chriſt himſelf, his body and bloud, not the benefits of Chriſt apart and abſtract, but Chriſt himſelf. It preſents Chriſt for intimate union with us, as the nouriſhment is to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: It preſents him really, as the bread and wine is really taken and received: It preſents him crucified and ſuffering, as if he was now dving and bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in whom faith findes reconciliation, remiſſion, juſtification and redemption, ſo is it acted and exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in this Ordinance.</p>

<pb n="294" facs="tcp:115895:157"/> ſinnes, which had they been charged on us, had ſunk us into the bottome of perdition, and who that ſees this ſhall not tremble at the fearfull wrath of God, which Angels and men could not ſtand before? Who ſhall not mourn over Chriſt, whom we have pierced, as it's ſaid of them, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12. 10? Who can love the knife that ſlew his friend?

Let us ſeal a Covenant of Obedience; By the merit of Chriſts death we are purchaſed to be Gods, not our own; By the power of his Death we are ſlain, dead to ſinne: But here I muſt break out to meet with our common purpoſers and reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which (if ever in their lives) do now, when they come toward the Lords Table, flatter God and themſelves with a new beginning of a new life, from this time they are reſolved, that the ear that hath heard them, ſhall hear them ſwear no more; The eye that hath ſeen them, ſhall ſee them drunk no more, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I would theſe greene cords would hold, but we finde this righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is but a morning dew, their <hi>Sampſon</hi> luſts, when they awake break all theſe cords, And why? BecaUſe theſe purpoſes ariſe from a fit of conſcience, not from a principle of life or love, and ſo they prove but <hi>Lucida intervalla,</hi> they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to their madneſſe againe, when the fit takes them. I would ſuch men would reſolve to be
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:115895:158"/> aſhamed of theſe reſolutions, which ſo often leave them in the dirt, that ſelfe confuſion may carry them out of their owne ſtrength, which ſelfe-reſolution doth but arme them with, and therefore doth not ſtand; For he that hath the Falling-ſickneſſe may reſolve to fall no more; but in vaine, untill the diſeaſe be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the principall, the ſtaple graces to be exerciſed in this Ordinance, there are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which are included in theſe, which I but name: As</p>

All confeſſe that Sacraments work by inſtitution of God, as the brazen Serpent healed the fiery ſting, but that is yet too ſhort; For doth Gods inſtitution elevate the nature of the Sacrament to produce the effect?

               <p>That you may have alwayes at hand (as a fyle to ſharpen your endeavours.) ſome brief Motives and Reaſons to awaken you; I ſhall briefly recite and offer to you theſe few.</p>

That as your coming worthily may yeeld a great improvement of your ſpiritual ſtate, ſo your coming unworthily may adde much to your guilt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation; The ſame paſſage through the red ſea was ſafe to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> by faith, the <hi>Egyptians</hi> aſſaying to do the like were all drowned, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 29.

                  <p>2. Though a Chriſtian is not altogether to judge of his receiving worthily by the fruitfull ſucceſſe and benefit which he findes, but by the exerciſe of his grace, and by his ſacramental diſpoſition, yet the fruit doth not follow, except there be a right Uſe, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy participation of the Ordinance. Some are ſo child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, and ſuch ſpiritual ſenſualiſts, that if they have not ſenſible and ſweet joy or comfort, or a preſent remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of their thorn, they conclude they come unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily. It's our fault, that as <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the wilderneſſe, we limit God to give that we deſire, or elſe murmur and think we have nothing: So it is in this Sacrament, and ſo in our prayers we are paſſionately deſirous of ſerving even our own luſts, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 3. The after-fruit cannot be the meaſure of our worthy receiving, but the preſent gracious frame of ſpirit, and exerciſe of our graces: As by fair and beautifull children we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not judge of lawfull marriage, but by conſent decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and ritely given at the preſent time, and yet the fruit and benefit comes not, but in and by the way of receiving worthily, we judge of our ſelves to be fit gueſts by the wedding garment, not the ſweet taſte of the Supper, and yet we cannot ſit down and eat, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept we have the wedding garment. We love a ſweet willing diſpoſition in a childe, ready to do what it can, than alwayes to be crying for plums. God highly prizes thoſe that ſet on work their obediential graces, to Obſerve the Law of any Ordinance, and perform it: for if we can luſt for quails, and yet murmur at the way of the wilderneſſe, we are too like the carnal

                     <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> There is in all ſpirituall joyes, comforts and raptures, two parts, the one is the fruition of the ſweet of them, the other is the ſerviceable Uſe of them to oil the wheels, and with more freedome to perform hardeſt duties of obedience. Now if in this latter reſpect we improve or ſeek them, it's farre the better to like in any Chriſtian, for it's Gods part or ſhare, <hi>The joy of the Lord is your ſtrength,</hi> yet duty is the door by which reward enters, as reaping comes by ſowing, <hi>They that ſow to the Spirit, ſhall of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit reap life everlaſting,</hi> Gal. 6. 8.</p>

                  <p>3. There is a ſacramental diſpoſition requiſite to a Sacramental Communion, and it is a very ſpiritual diſpoſition, as the Communion is ſpiritual: This di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſition is not one ſingle grace, but a complexion or temperament made up of divers ingredients, which are not all diſtinctly and eminently acted by every man at this preſent, but ſome of them, as occaſion and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity may require. I have already ſhown you them in general, and told you, that they are beſpoken by the Sacrament it ſelf, and as it were deduced from it. This Sacrament affords us the communion of Chriſts death, where his body broken, and bloud ſhed are ſet before us; Here we communicate of a dying Chriſt, in heaven we ſhall have him as a Tree of life. This is that <hi>epulum foederale,</hi> or Covenant-feaſt made for confederates, God is one party, and the faithfull are the other, and both parties of confederates do (<hi>ſic dicam</hi>) partake of the ſame foederal Sacrifice, Chriſt Jeſus, the bloud of the Sacrifice is offer'd up to God.
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:115895:161"/> The ſame bloud in the Sacrament is offer'd and given to us, as it's ſaid, <hi>Exod. 24. 6. Moſes took half the blood and ſprinkled it on the Altar, and he ſprinkled the other on the people, and ſaid, Behold the bloud of the Covenant.</hi> If we underſtood the Ordinance, we ſhould eaſily agree, that a ſacramental diſpoſition is a very ſpiritual diſpoſition, and requires the very pureſt addreſſes that we can make to it, where God himſelf entertains his people with no other cheer than which ſatisfies himſelf, and will have them taſte of that which he himſelf is pleaſed and delighted with, that is (I ſay again) Chriſt Jeſus. Now in this ſo near approach to God, ye have an excellent Rule, as in all other ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, <hi>Levit. 10. 3. I will be ſanctified in them that come nigh me,</hi> the caſe was, that two Prieſts had taken ſtrange or other fire, not Gods fire from his Altar, but other fire, common fire, and ſo themſelves became the Sacrifice, for God will not be ſlighted. If we bring fire, and it be not his own but ours, we may be conſumed by it, but he not pleaſed. To which end and purpoſe, that we be not found in this caſe, and under this wrath, I ſhall endeavour to ſhew you that ſtrange fire, or thoſe falſe and inſufficient qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which men draw nigh to God in this Sacrament withall, to their own hurt and prejudice.</p>

Art thou

Weakneſſe of faith in our times is properly ſaid of this manner of believing. It's the receiving hand that ſhakes with the palſie; Few complain of weakneſſe of faith hiſtorical, nor
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:115895:163"/> of the hardneſſe of it, becaUſe it's not encountred with diſcouragements, ſins, temptations, as ſaving faith is, becaUſe the whole adventure of the ſoul lies upon it, and God knows when we come to ſhoot the gulf, and to renounce all falſe hopes, or true fears, and caſt our ſelves on Chriſt, we do it with great difficulty, for without Gods attraction it's impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and this is the faith which we muſt be exerciſed in, and which is confirmed by this Sacrament, and a rare faith it is, even in the believing world; For it gives up man to Chriſt, as well as receives Chriſt; And the diſ-intereſſing of ſelf-love, and the intereſſing of Chriſt into preheminence and government is very rare and infrequent; For I count that no receiving of Chriſt, which divides him, and takes ſo much as ſelf-love would ſerve it ſelf upon, but brings not every thought into captivity to the obedience of him.</p>
               <p>IV. If thou finde in thy affections any appearances or ſeeming impreſſions of grace, be not over-credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous till the bottom be ſearched, for there lies abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of ſelf-love, and ſelf-intereſt, even when there is a good countenance and fore-ſide; as in the zeal of <hi>Jehu,</hi> which carried in the fore-head of it, <hi>The Lord of hoſts,</hi> but there was a byas within that wheeled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his own intereſt, I ſhall name but four, and that briefly.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>2</label> 1. The love of God which is a reflex of his firſt love to us; As the Sun-beams which come from the wall are the reflex of the beams that firſt ſmite upon it, and there may be a love of God upon terms of his beneficence, providence, patience, general good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to mankinde without any love of Chriſt in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:115895:164"/> which is upon ſpecial and diſtinguiſhing grounds, for that love of God which is over-topt by ſelf-love, is not accounted love of God, but rather a luſt of ſerving our ſelves upon him, which is the laſt reſort of the love of moſt men to God, but it may be diſtinguiſht thus, If it ariſe from the ſenſe of that diſtinguiſhing love of God to thy ſoul, whereby he hath drawn thee to Chriſt out of the pit of common perdition, and that without any worthineſſe in thee, or contributions of thine to that ineſtimable grace, yea notwithſtanding that contrariety and oppoſition to him, wherein thou waſt above many others inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, the very thought whereof doth ever inflame the heart unto a mans dying day: If it be a love to God for his holineſſe and his ſanctification of thee to bear his Image, and to be like him: If it be a love of complacency and friendſhip, to delight thy ſelf in God, and to affect Union and Communion with him: If it produce a willingneſſe to confederate with him, and to be in league, againſt all intereſts of the fleſh and world: I love my maſter, I will not go out free, or be at my own freedom.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond affection is deſire of grace, and of ſpiritual things. I conceive there may be a carnal deſire of things ſpiritual, and carnal prayers for ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual gifts, namely to conſume them upon our luſts of pride and vain-glory, which is the deſire of <hi>Simon Magus;</hi> a deſire to die the death of the righteous, which was the wiſh of <hi>Balaam,</hi> a deſire of forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſinne to be freed from condemnation by meer ſelf love, a deſire of heaven too, to open unto us, for happineſſe not holineſſe or communion with God, a deſire comfort to anguiſh of conſcience, and that
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:115895:164"/> rather for eaſe, than for grace, a deſire of grace it ſelf, as a neceſſary bridge unto, or ſigne of ſalvation; <hi>Give us of your oyl</hi> (ſay they) <hi>for our lamps are out;</hi> Many fallacies may be in our deſires, and yet I account them, when they are refined from droſſe, to be moſt comfortable ſignes of ſpiritual life, for Chriſt makes <hi>thirſting after rightcouſneſſe</hi> the character of a bleſſed man, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. and the Apoſtle makes them a <hi>fruit of repentance,</hi> 2 Cor. 7. 11. and a <hi>ſigne of regencration,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 2. if they ariſe from a taſte of the graciouſneſſe of God, and carry on to the ſincere Word for growth in grace, and be ſpent in endeavours of obedience, and exerciſe of communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God, equally longing to be Chriſts, as to have Chriſt: He that ſhall deny to a poor ſoul the comfort of ſuch deſires puts out the ſpark that ſmokes in the wick of the candle, when the flame is gone out before.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third affection is fear, the fear of the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of the Lord, and thoſe puniſhments which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his threats wait upon ſinne. <hi>Eſtius</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds the caſe, Whether a man under ſervile fear may come to the Lords Supper? And anſwers, No, but with diſtinction, the fear of wrath may be Uſed as a bridle to curb the inſolency and luxuriency of the fleſh, by ſaying hell and damnation cloſe to it, and ſo the regenerate, whoſe fleſh is impetuous, may make Uſe of this fear to reſtrain the propenſion of it, but then if this fear be meerly of puniſhment, ſo that were it not for that, he would with all his heart give himſelf over to commit iniquity with greedineſſe, then it's plain, that the willingneſſe to ſinne lives, and this horrour of conſcience nothing at all changes the inclination of the will, no more than the whip or
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:115895:165"/> chain doth the nature of a Fox or Wolf, and the caſe is no other than that of a childe that will colly him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with the cole that's black and dead, but dare not touch the fire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cole which burnes his fingers, and there is no comfort in ſuch reſtraints from ſinne, nor have ſuch feares any ſparke of grace in them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth affection is ſorrow for ſinne, which may be worldly and carnal, and no other than <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roah</hi> his, <hi>Take away this plague;</hi> or the pangs of a whore that returns to folly; But there is a ſorrow according to God, which works repentance unto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and brings forth thoſe ſeven fruits, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 11. which change the frame of the heart, a happy mother of ſo many good children: Theſe are the pangs of a godly ſoul, and it is one of the firſt ſteps unto, or parts of the Reſurrection of a Chriſtian from his fals, and is caUſed not meerly by wrath, but as <hi>Peters</hi> weeping was by the looks of Chriſt; The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs, the frowns, the offence of a gracious God, thaws the heart into melting tears, and would do ſo, though there were no hell; As a meek childe needs no other hoUſe of correction than his fathers looks. I am loath to be of that opinion which baniſhes godly ſorrow out of Religion; For if I were ſo happy as to want new matter and occaſion for it, yet ſometimes to review old forgiven ſins, and the rather, becaUſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given with freſh bleeding heart, doth excellently keep down ſwelling of pride, and gives a freſh and new reliſh to Chriſt Jeſus, ſo the overflowing ſtoods do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich the adjacent grounds, and make them freſh and greene. And ſo much concerning theſe affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="311" facs="tcp:115895:165"/>V. The fifth Conſideration is of purpoſes of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment, which we named before, among the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratives to this Sacrament, which there are few but have at one time or other, and men do exceedingly befool and flatter themſelves in them; For we have known that upon conviction of conſcience and ſhame, for many years together by fits and moods, and for the skinning over ſome gallings of conſcience, men flie to purpoſes of repentance, and put them on, and binde themſelves by vows or other bonds, to doe no more, and yet experience tels us, that <hi>Sampſon</hi> did not eaſilier break the cords that bound him than theſe men do break their purpoſes, and cancell all bonds and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, and ſo a ſick mans purpoſes are very often no other than the vows of a Mariner in a ſtorm at ſea, who for the time will be or do any thing, but when the danger is blown over, they are as they were. You ask, What ſuch are to do? And the anſwer is ready, Reſolution without mortification is to little purpoſe, the luſt muſt be mortified that carries the ſway and dominion; For as the purpoſes of a man in his lucid intervals, or of one that hath the Falling ſickneſſe to fall no more, is to little purpoſe, without ſome appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to the diſeaſe that ſtill lies within, and will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn and break all dams that are made by the ſtreame of it; ſo are reſolutions upon conviction of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence without effectual exerciſe of mortification by ſetting upon that root and luſt which between whiles doth but ſleep, and will awaken again. Let the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſee and ſearch his ſinne, and apply the corzy of the Law, and Uſe thoſe ſharp medicines which eat out a rotten core, and follow that ſharp work of mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or elſe all is to little purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="312" facs="tcp:115895:166"/>VI. The laſt thing I mention'd was thankfulneſſe, a grace proper to the Euchariſt, which ſignifies thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, and is the denomination of this Sacrament, wherein thankſgiving is ſo eminently required and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed, and it riſes either from the general ground, or from the ſpecial; The general is Gods <hi>Philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropy,</hi> which ſhews it ſelf in a <hi>ſic dilexit,</hi> by giving Chriſt a Saviour to us, and not to the Angels that ſinn'd, and is worthy to fill our hearts and mouths with admiration to all eternity; But the ſpecial ground is Gods incorporation of us particularly into Chriſt by giving that differencing grace, which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhes not from Devils, but from reprobates and hypocrites, and all that are called, but not choſen, which is a mark of ſpecial favour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thankſgiving for this ſhall be the work of heaven, where we ſhall bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter underſtand and look upon our former miſery, as a fyle to ſet off and illuſtrate our glorious redemption, and to this tune ought our hearts to be ſet here, <hi>For in this rejoyce not, that the devils fall before you, but that your names are written in heaven;</hi> and we have caUſe while we are in this lower orb to be thankfull, for the leaſt muſtar-ſeed of faith and grace, whoſe work is to ſet a byas upon the will, to chUſe God, and ſet up his intereſt above all intereſts of ſelf or world, and he keeps this ſpark alive in worſt times by no leſſe a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle than a ſpark of fire in the ſea, and that he inables this little grace to fight and combate (and that is in Scripture to conquer) againſt the powerfull fears and oppreſſions of the world, and the powerfull allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of luſt, and eaſe, and pleaſures of ſinne, which is a Sunſhine that uſually puts out our fire more eaſily than cold and nipping froſts, which rather make it
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:115895:166"/> hotter, and this is the meaning of that phraſe, <hi>He will not quench,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>till he ſend forth judgement unto vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory;</hi> The ſmoak ends in victory.</p>

THere is a great benefit of this Sacrament to them that communicate therein preparedly; though all be not agreed, what the benefit is, as may be ſeen by the Doctrine of the Papiſts, the <hi>Socinians,</hi> the Orthodox, yet that there is a benefit, few will deny; and if it be denied, the ſenſible experience of many godly Chriſtians doth atteſt it, to which expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience the Apoſtle ſometimes appeals, ſaying, <hi>Gal. 3. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This onely would I learn of you;</hi> and for others that will not own their experiences, or have them not, Reaſon may convince them, That as God made no Uſeleſſe creature, ſo he ordains no fruitleſſe inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, that this Ordinance being inſtituted for the Uſe of his ſelect people and confederates, and that at ſuch a time as our Lord Chriſt had the very powers of darkneſſe to encounter with, therefore it is an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of ſome moment, which began at the death, and ſtands in force until the ſecond coming of Chriſt, and if nothing elſe could be ſaid, this is enough. That the guilt and danger of receiving unworthily being ſo dreadfull, there muſt in Reaſon be ſome proportion
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:115895:167"/> of benefit and fruit to the receiving worthily, which Reaſon may convince any rational man, that there is not only a good, but that good is of very great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion and degree, and that ye ſhall not come for fruit to a barren fig-tree.</p>
               <p>I have Reaſon to demonſtrate both theſe points:

Leaſt this Sacrament of ſo great moment be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified and brought to contempt, as a dry teat or em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty veſſel, they muſt needs neglect both the Uſe of this Sacrament, and all preparation thereunto that undervalue it, as fruitleſſe and not beneficial; Who will take any pains to go to a dry Well that hath no water in it? It's vain to urge preparations on them that are not perſwaded of any benefit in it; And though I will not diſpute, Whether the ſupream Lord may not oblige his creature, man, for probation and trial of his obedience, to a duty whence no other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit ſhould redound, but the very duty of obedience, As if he oblige <hi>Abraham</hi> by a Law to ſacrifice his ſonne, yet I conceive that Gods ſtanding Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Laws, do not only oblige a duty, but intend a benefit, and thereby invite obedience, as it's ſaid, <hi>Deut. 10. 13. What doth the Lord require of thee, but to keep his Commandments for thy good?</hi> And that therefore there is a benefit of the right Uſe of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, by which we may lawfully be excited and
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:115895:168"/> impell'd to Obſerve the Ordinance, as we climb the tree for the fruit that is upon it; It's true, an unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Communicant reaps no other benefit than ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what that is like that which the Apoſtle cals, the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage and profit of the Jew, <hi>Rom. 3. 1. Rom.</hi> 9. 4. viz. <hi>Tabulas &amp; ſigilla foederis,</hi> the Tables and Seals of the Covenant, but the Reaſon that he receives no inward and ſpiritual fruit, is not becaUſe there is no water in this Well, but becaUſe he hath no bucket to draw it forth; For God offers and holds forth Chriſt and the benefits of the Covenant, his hand is not empty, but our hand is full of ſinne and ſelf-righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, that we cannot receive it, for they that will receive muſt bring a capacity. It's a known truth, He that means to receive a benefit which is convey'd by way of Covenant, muſt bring the Condition of that Covenant in his hand, as he that comes to a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble brings life and ſtomack.</p>
                  <p>I know there are ſome, and they godly, that fear, or haply will boldly affirm, that they were never ſenſible of the benefit of this Sacrament; They hear of good fruit, but they have not taſted it, and therefore their edge is dull and flat to the receiving of it. To which I anſwer this, That if there be an exerciſe of the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces required in the act of receiving, they may not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the fruit of the Ordinance, becaUſe they are not ſo clearly ſenſible at the preſent, for haply they limit God to the preſent time, or confine their expectations to ſome particular fruit, as elevation of heart, ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble comfort, clear aſſurance, or the like, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caUſe they finde not, they think they have nothing. I have ſhew'd you before, That God anſwers the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations and ſatisfies the neceſſity of his people by
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:115895:168"/> giving ſome other grace than we would have, or have our eye upon, as <hi>Pauls</hi> prayers were anſwer'd in <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient grace,</hi> not the removing of the thorn; We cry for comfortable ſigns, and God gives o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bediential and ſerviceable graces; We look for ſpiritual gifts, he gives humbling grace; We would have conQueſt of ſinne, God gives power to encounter it; We look for lively grace, and God keeps grace alive; We expect at preſent, God after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward gives us it; in bodily nouriſhment it's not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for a man to tell what degree of nouriſhment he received by ſuch a meal, yet he findes that he lives, and is ſtrengthned, and he may be nouriſht by that which he doth not reliſh with delight. As for thoſe that upon pretence of ſpirit and ſpirituality have caſt off Ordinances, as fruitleſſe unto them, I ſhould wiſh they would conſider, whether they be not rather beſides their wits, than above Ordinances, ſeeing Chriſt himſelf doth not onely by his inſtitution but example, commend this Sacrament unto us, as a ſtanding Ordinance, for the whole Church <hi>untill he come,</hi> and ſo hath commended the Miniſtry alſo, <hi>till we all come to a full ſtature,</hi> Epheſ. 4. 11. I would know how that ſpirit which hath carried them to the pinacle of the Temple, and hath ſet them above Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, or that witneſſes to them without graces, can be proved to be the Spirit of Chriſt, and if they would ſhew us how they can live without meat and drink too, there would be ſome hope that they might be ſtarved into their ſenſes and right minds.</p>

<pb n="318" facs="tcp:115895:169"/> What that benefit is, and I have Reaſon to ſhew what it is.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. BecaUſe ſuperſtitious and carnal perſons do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect what they have no warrant to expect, perverting the Uſe of this Sacrament to other intents and ends, than it hath by inſtitution of Chriſt; The ſick man too ſuperſtitiouſly conceives that the <hi>opus operatum</hi> is a <hi>viaticum,</hi> that will pay his fare for a preſent paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage into heaven, or that it is like a Popiſh ſhrift that blots out all ſinne, and wipes off the old ſcore.

BecaUſe commonly men have confUſed thoughts of a benefit, but they know not what; They think it's good for ſomething, but they know not what, and ſo do as it were take phyſick meerly upon truſt, not knowing what is in it; Hence is that awfulneſſe of this Ordinance with all men, they muſt be holy now at this time, they muſt not follow their wicked and looſe wayes; They are going to the Sacrament, and they go with an ignorant reverence, not knowing what is either the fruit or the danger of it.

                  <p n="1">1. The benefit of the Sacrament is of an higher nature than theſe creatures are able to convey, and therefore they are ſtampt and made inſtrumental by an inſtitution of God; It had been both vain and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious to have expected ſpiritual benefit by the Uſe of theſe elements, had not the word of inſtitution given a new relation to them, which without it they have not. There might a ſimilitude or repreſentation have bin borrowed to ſignifie the ſufferings of Chriſt, but that would not have made a Sacrament, any more than marriage repreſenting the myſtical union of Chriſt and the Church is therefore a Sacrament; There muſt be a promiſe and a command of God ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the viſible creature, whereby the Uſe of it to ſuch a purpoſe is warranted and authorized, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt look higher than the outward elements, or their power; An Axe is more than iron; A Seal is more than wax; Gods inſtitution renders the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of bread and wine (which as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> notes, though two elements are but one inſtrument or ſeal) Uſefull to ſpiritual effects, not by elevating their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as the iron or wax being inſtruments are not elevated to any efficacy, as phyſical inſtruments, but by appointing their Uſe and working by them, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Queſtion, How can bread and wine, How can water reach or touch the ſoul is impertinent? for it refers to a natural cauſation; but moral relation needs no contact, there is a benefit follows upon the right Uſe of them, which comes not through them <hi>tanquam per canalem</hi> but from God by the Uſe of ſuch means, as an eſtate is convey'd from the donor by a ſeal of wax.</p>

The benefits and bleſſings promiſed in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace are ſealed, and the graces of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant are improved in a believer by this Ordinance, Chriſt, Chriſt crucified, or rather in crucifying, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with ſuch benefits as are immediately ſealed in his death, reconciliation, redemption, remiſſion of ſinnes, as on Gods part offered to a ſinner, are here Obſignate and ſealed: And faith in Chriſt, repentance from dead works, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are here exerciſed, excited, confirmed, renewed, the main fundamental and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential benefits and graces which are in moſt neceſſary order to ſalvation, are here in act, not ſuch things as ſome Chriſtians have, and ſome have not, But the common neceſſaries of the Covenant, both on Gods part and ours, without which no Chriſtian can be ſaved; And therefore I cannot but wonder, that many well-meaning ſouls ſhould fix their eyes on ſuch benefits or gifts to be given in this Sacrament, as are not <gap reason="foreign">

This I would have Obſerved for the honour of the Ordinance, and the quickning of addreſſe to it.</p>

                  <p>And another thing alſo, <hi>viz.</hi> That when you hear us Uſe the words <hi>exhibit, convey, conferre, afford grace</hi> or ſpiritual benefits: You are to underſtand, that this is not <hi>per modem emplaſtri, ſeu medicae potionis,</hi> not as a natural agent, but <hi>per modum ſigilli,</hi> or <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menti,</hi> in a way proper to a Sacrament; As we ſay, an eſtate paſſes by the Seal, that is, is aſſured or confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or as we ſay the promiſe or contract paſſes by a Ring, words which every one underſtands; and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the benefit and fruit of the Sacrament is afforded in a peculiar way; As the Word, beſides begetting grace, doth alſo incReaſe and confirm, but not in the ſame way as the Sacrament doth; as it may be the ſame bargain that paſſes by promiſe, by oath, by earneſt, by ſeal, yet theſe are ſeveral wayes of certioration; ſo it's the ſame grace that's nouriſht by the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as by the Word, but the way is divers; That of the Sacrament is by way of ſign and ſeal, that of the Word by way of Promiſe or Covenant-agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; nay the two Sacraments themſelves do differ in their proprieties, Baptiſm ſeals the Covenant by way of initiation, and the Lords Supper by way of nutrition or augmentation.

                  <p>For the firſt, There is here done by Chriſt two things, and anſwerably two things by a believer in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Two things principally are here done by God, or by Chriſt.
<list>
                        <item>1. Chriſt crucified is really exhibited to the faith of a believer.</item>
                        <item>2. The gracious Covenant which God hath made in Chriſt is ſealed to a believer.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Chriſt crucified, together with all thoſe bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits <note place="margin">More particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly.</note> that enſue upon his death, is really exhibited to a believer; for there is not a meer repreſentation, or empty figure, but a real and true exhibition of Chriſt himſelf, as broken for our ſinnes. The word <hi>accipite, Take ye, Eat ye,</hi> does evidently confirm it to us; If there were only a reſemblance or figurative repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, then <hi>See ye,</hi> were more properly ſaid, but <hi>Take, Eat, this is my body,</hi> plainly ſhews, that Chriſt himſelf is here given to a believer. I think we look ſo much on the repreſentation, that we forget the exhibition, and therefore ſhould labour to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that Chriſt himſelf, as in the ſtate of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming Saviour is truly and indeed holden forth and preſented to our faith, as verily as any benefit can be offer'd and holden forth by one man to another. This body and bloud was really offer'd up to God for us, which is in this Sacrament really offer'd and applied
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:115895:171"/> to us by our faith: Anſwerable to this exhibition of Chriſt himſelf, the believer performs an act of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 16. partaking of the body and bloud of Chriſt in a ſpiritual ſenſe, for ſpiritual nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, incReaſe and building up; for the new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is fed and maintain'd by Chriſt, and by vertue of union with him, we have communion, as the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branches by their union with the Vine, receive ſap and nouriſhment; So as we have not graces without Chriſt, nor benefits without Chriſt, but firſt in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of nature we have union as members of him, and then of his fulneſſe we receive; For a Chriſtian is like a branch that hath nothing of its own, but what it receives from the root, as it ſelf ſprings from the root, ſo the incReaſe and growth of it is from the root alſo; He is as the Moon, which, as appears in the Eclypſe, hath no light of it ſelf, but incReaſes and comes to full; as it receives from the Sunne; Let no man think that a believer hath no further Uſe of Chriſt after his firſt believing and receiving of him, for then this Sacrament would not be Uſefull, the effect where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as <hi>Durand</hi> ſaith, is not abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation, as if one could not be in a ſtate of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on without it, becaUſe it ſerves for confirmation of one that is already in a ſaving ſtate; and it's plain, that a great part of Chriſts Office is exerciſed in preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and continuing of them in him, who are alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy members of him, and therefore is the <hi>finiſher</hi> as well as <hi>authour</hi> of our faith, for we <hi>live in him,</hi> and <hi>from him,</hi> and our grace is maintain'd by emanations from Chriſt, as the light by continual emanations from the Sunne, and therefore this Ordinance of Communion of Chriſt, and the exerciſe of ſuch acts
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:115895:172"/> of communion are of prime Uſe and benefit, as the branch that ſhoots from the Tree, grows and lives from that root which gave to it the firſt being by a contrived influx of ſap into it. And this is the firſt combination of Gods act, and of ours.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond combination is, The gracious Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant which God hath made in Chriſt, is ſealed to a believer; The common nature of a Sacrament is to be a ſeal of Juſtification or Righteouſneſſe with God by faith in Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11. As a ſeal refers to ſome Covenant, ſo the Sacrament refers to Gods Covenant with man, which is this, That God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to accept into favour, and into his propriety all that do believe in, and receive Chriſt, and to beſtow upon them all the bleſſings and benefits thereof. God gives Chriſt in way of Covenant; He covenants with Chriſt our Lord, that he ſhould <hi>give his ſoul an offering and a Sacrifice for ſin, and in ſo doing ſhould ſee his ſeed, Iſa.</hi> 53. 10. So <hi>Arminius</hi> in this point is orthodox. Of this Covenant the death or bloud of Chriſt is the Condition which Chriſt accepted and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
                  <p>The Covenant of God with us is, That all that believe in Chriſt that died, and receive him for their Lord and Saviour, ſhall have remiſſion of ſins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and of this Covenant the bloud of Chriſt is the ratification, as the Teſtators death ratifies the Will or Teſtament, for it is bloud that doth <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, dedicate the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 18. and ſo in the words of this Chapter, <hi>This Cup is the New Teſtament</hi> (or Covenant) <hi>in my bloud,</hi> viz. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, dedicated thereby, and this bloud we receive in this Sacrament, as the Seal of the gracious Covenant made with us; So that if
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:115895:172"/> doubts ariſe concerning the reality of God, and ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of this Covenant that ſpeaks ſo much grace and mercy, we look upon and take hold of this Seale of bloud, and are thereby ſetled, and therein acquieſce.</p>
                  <p>Anſwerable to this act of God, the believer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of, and ſubmits to this Covenant and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of it, <hi>viz.</hi> to believe, and to have God for our God, and thereof makes a ſolemn profeſſion in this Sacrament, giving up himſelf to Chriſt, as Lord and Saviour, reſtipulating and ſtriking hands with him, to be his, and ſo bindes himſelf, and doth as it were ſeal a counterpart to God again, and not onely ſo, but comes into a claim of all the riches and lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the Will or Covenant, becaUſe he hath acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted and here declares his acceptance of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. The Seal is indeed properly of that which is Gods part of the Covenant to perform and give, and is no more but offer'd, untill we ſubſcribe and ſet our hands to it, and then it's compleat, and the benefits may be claimed, as the benefit of any conditional promiſe may be, when the condition is performed; And leaſt you ſhould ſtumble at that word, I muſt let you know, That the Will accepting and ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the conditions, is the performance of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions required, and ſo the gracious God that might <hi>pro imperio,</hi> require duty and allegiance of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, condeſcends to us to enter into a Covenant of Grace with us, and vouchſafes us the honour of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into Covenant with him, that ſo he might ſettle and maintain a communion and correſpondence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween himſelf and his people, and there might be a mutual bond of engagement each to other, which
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:115895:173"/> is ſolemnly profeſſed, as often as we meet with God in this Sacrament, becaUſe we are ſo apt to disbelieve and waver about his promiſes, and to halt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline from our obligations to him. And this is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond combination of action, according to that which is to be remembred at every ſealing day, (the Sacrament is a ſealing day) <hi>Deut. 26. 17. Thou haſt avouched the Lord this day to be thy God, and to walk in his wayes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And the Lord hath avou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched thee to be his peculiar people, as he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed thee.</hi> So much for the firſt, What is here done.</p>

I come to the ſecond, What is here received, and I do not mean to ſay, what every believer doth ſenſibly receive, but what God hath appointed by this Sacrament to convey, and what may be received by a believer in the right Uſe of it, not alwayes to his own ſenſe, but according to the nature of this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance.</p>
                  <p>I will not ſay that which ſome affirm (but it is A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocryphal) of the Manna which the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did eat, that it had the taſte that every man deſired; But this I may ſay, that as <hi>Calvin</hi> of himſelf, <hi>When I have</hi>

                     <hi>ſaid all, I have ſaid but little, the tongue is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, yea the minde is overwhelmed;</hi> I ſay then in one word,</p>
                  <p>1. Chriſt is here received, the body and bloud of Chriſt into intimate Union, as the nouriſhment of our ſouls. What is more ours than the meat we eat?
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:115895:173"/> What is more nearly joyn'd to us, than that which becomes part of our ſelves? The Scripture by the language it Uſeth hath even overcome our apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; A man may eat the fruit that hath no intereſt in the Tree, but here the believing eater grows into the Tree, he that drinks, drinks the fountain, he comes to a cloſer Union with the conduit-pipe of all grace, the fleſh of Jeſus Chriſt; You know the beſt meat and drink doth you no good, except it be made your own; nor is Chriſt of worth, except he be ours, he is, as if he were not. <hi>Tolle meum, tolle Deum,</hi> we muſt be happy by a Chriſt within us, <hi>Know you not that Chriſt is in you, except you be Reprobates,</hi> 2 Cor. 13. 5. There was a croud toucht Chriſt, but <hi>vertue went out of him to none but one</hi> that <hi>toucht</hi> him by <hi>faith;</hi> So there is a throng about the Table, but none receive Chriſt, but thoſe that by faith take and eat his crucified body. If Chriſt himſelf be here received, what ſpiritual grace is there that is not in him.</p>
                  <p>It is ſomewhat a groſſe conceit to ask, How Chriſt in heaven, and a believer on earth can be united? For man and wife are one fleſh, though a thouſand miles aſunder; And we know, that as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Col. 2. 19. there are bands and joynts whereby the Head and every Member, the root and every branch are united,</hi> and they in this <hi>myſtical union</hi> are <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>faith. He that is joyned to the Lord is one Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 17. And ſo according to that ſtrange expreſſion, <hi>We are members of his body, of his fleſh, and of his bones,</hi> Epheſ. 5. 30 A phraſe which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies that the humane nature of Chriſt is the root of this Union, but not to be exagitated by too
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:115895:174"/> ſubtill curioſity, becaUſe myſticall.</p>
                  <p>2. A believer in Chriſt may here receive remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſinne, not veniall onely, as Papiſts teach, but deadly and mortall: Oh, but we may not come with ſuch ſinnes! Yes, with repentance and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe for them; We may bring our ſinnes to the head of our Sacrifice, and put them thereupon by <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Bellarm.</hi> de Euch <hi>l. 4 c 18.</hi>
                     </note> confeſſion. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> reſolves all the difference between Papiſts and Proteſtants about the effect of this Sacrament into this, That the Papiſts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, the Proteſtants hold remiſſion of ſinne to be given here, and the Papiſts do it in favour of their Sacrament of Pennance, that one Sacrament may not rob another, but Scripture tels us, <hi>Matth. 26. 28. This is my bloud of the New Testament which is ſhed for many for remiſsion of ſinne;</hi> Shed for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, that's true, ſaith <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> not given in the Sacrament, a meer evaſion, for we drink the bloud that was ſhed, even that which confirmes the New Teſtament, which promiſes remiſſion of ſinne. The great Argument wherein he triumphs before the victory, is, That a believer hath remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſinnes before he comes, <hi>viz</hi> by his faith in Chriſt, and that's true, <hi>Nemo cibum Chriſti ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipit niſi actu ſanatus,</hi> but in this Sacrament the pardon paſſes <hi>Obſignante ſigillo,</hi> before a believer is pardon'd by the Covenant; and here that pardon is ſeal'd, and ſealed it cannot be, except it be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for the pardon of forgiven ſinnes is ſeal'd, as <hi>Abraham received the ſigne of circumciſion, the ſeale of the righteouſneſſe of faith, which he had before, Rom.</hi> 4. 11. And this is needfull for reliefe of our doubts, and fears, and waverings; For this
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:115895:174"/> is the great Queſtion of anxiety, which troubles the ſoul; Are my ſinnes pardon'd? Are my ſins blotted out? And God hath, ſaith <hi>Chemnitius,</hi> inſtituted this Sacrament for ſolution of this Queſtion, to the weak faith, <hi>Ecce ſignum,</hi> Behold the Seal, believe upon the Word, believe upon the Seal of God. <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> gathers it by a gradation, <hi>The Cup is put for the Wine, the Wine ſignifies the bloud, the bloud is the bloud of the New Teſtament,</hi> Matth. 26. 28. The New Teſtament containes the gracious pardon of ſinne to a believer; And if remiſſion of ſinne be an Article of the Covenant, the Seale muſt reach it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Therefore all that have wounded their ſouls with grievous ſinnes be wounded again with ſorrow, put off the purpoſe of ſinning, bring re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and faith, touch the hemme of Chriſt, receive here the pardon of ſin, Queſtion not the Seal or truth of it.</p>
                  <p>3. That I may not divide into further par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, there is by this Sacrament a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of a greater proportion of Goſpel-Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, <hi>For we have been all made to drinke into one Spirit,</hi> 2 Cor. 12. 13. which Spirit plentifully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows his ſeverall fruits and graces, for the grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of a member into Chriſt the Head in all things, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 15. from whence we have not onely thoſe <hi>Auxilia actualia,</hi> actual influences, and aids of delight, comfort, evidence, ſweet taſtes, powerfull motions and impreſſions, which <hi>Vaſquez</hi> cals, grace ſacramental, and ſaith, That <hi>Gratia Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentalis non eſt gratia habitualis, ſed auxilia quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam actualia,</hi> which I conceive is an errour; For
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:115895:175"/> though a man have a ſweet taſte and tranſient delight in meat or wine, yet there is alſo a permanent and abiding nouriſhment proceeding from that he eats or drinks: So here the very habituall graces are nouriſht, ſtrengthened, excited: It may be a man at preſent doth not feele that ſtrength he doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, nor is ſenſible of the intention of his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: For the ſame <hi>Vaſquez</hi> ſaith, <hi>Intentionem habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuum infuſorum ſub experimento humano cadere non poſſe;</hi> And it's true at preſent time; But the growth of grace manifeſts it ſelfe in time; We doe not ſee our ſelves or others grow, but that we are growne is plaine enough; nor doe we ſee how much the light incReaſes by every ſtep of the Sunne riſing higher; for our growth is gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duall, and by imperceptible inſtances and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, when power of reſiſting temptations, mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie luſts, which before were too hard for us, doth appear, we may ſee our growth, as we ſee our ſhadowes are ſhortened, but how much in a minute we ſee not, and may ſay, That the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which this Ordinance requires and excites, are thereby ſtrengthened and enlarged, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Rule is good, What Grace thou would<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt have ſtrengthened by this Ordinance, that doe thou ſet on work, and exerciſe in it, for that is <hi>Sowing to the Spirit,</hi> as the Apoſtle cals it; And I make no Queſtion but a believer ſhall finde the benefit of this Sacrament in his obedience alſo, for the fuller the Veſſell is, the faſter it will runne out at the tap: If the habits incReaſe, the fruit of obedience will be proportionable; We
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:115895:175"/> mend a barren Tree at the root, ſweeten the ſap there, and the Tree is more fruitfull; When <hi>Jacob</hi> had ſeen the ſweet viſion in <hi>Bethel,</hi> then he lifted up his feet, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 29. 1. it put mettle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him.</p>
                  <p>So much for this Point, the Benefit of this Sacrament, which being diſ-Uſed, as at this time, is a great loſſe to the improvement of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, though they ſee it not. The Chriſtians in perſecuting times, when a ſtorme was coming, then were they moſt diligent to frequent this Table, to lay in ſtore for a hard Winter, and fortifie their reſolutions. And let this Benefit be a Motive to the Uſe of Preparation, which was the Reaſon I have handled it in this place, for there is no Promiſe, no Benefit to one that comes to this Table unworthily.</p>

Now I come to the other branch, The eating and drinking unworthily; What that is hath been ſufficiently open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed already. The <hi>Antitheſis</hi> or oppoſition between worthily and unworthily is ſuch, as if you know the one, you know both, as he that knows what a right line is, knows what is a crooked or oblique; Worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to eat is in ſuch manner as is anſwerable and ſuitable to the nature, end, and Uſe of the Ordinance, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily to eat is contrary, that is without a ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental or Supper-diſpoſition, and otherwiſe then is fit, that theſe holy myſteries be handled and intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as I have before proved.</p>
               <p>The Point I ſhall take up is this,</p>

                  <hi>To eat the bread and drink the Cup of the Lord un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily, is a ſinne of an high Nature, and of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence dangerous.</hi> It is a fearfull ſinne, and attended with fearfull effect. It is of a high nature, as appears by that peculiar guilt which is contracted, he ſhall

                  <hi>what a terrible word the Apoſtle ſpeaks, ſpeaks, nay thunders, ſo as may awake the ſecure ſoul into a trembling.</hi> The example of <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> their being made Sacrifices themſelves, was enough to give warning to all after them againſt offering of ſtrange fire, and was the occaſion of that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Rule which God gave at that time to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in all our near approaches to him, <hi>I will be ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified of all that come nigh me,</hi> Lev. 10. 3.</p>
               <p>There are four things to be open'd:</p>
               <p n="1">1. The ſin it ſelf, <hi>viz. Eating and drinking un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily.</hi>
               </p>

               <p n="4">4. The danger that attends or follows upon it, <hi>He eats and drinks judgement to himſelf.</hi>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>3</label> 1. The ſinne is <hi>Eating and drinking unworthily,</hi> and it is a peculiar ſinne or tranſgreſſion of the Law of this Ordinance; One may do what the Law requires, and yet ſinne grievouſly, if the manner of doing be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and corrupt; Men may be content, if the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by their Law required be done, whether with a good will or an evil, but God is not ſo, who values the diſpoſition of heart, when the thing in command ſometimes is not done; ſo he hearkned to <hi>Hezekiah</hi> his prayer for them that <hi>prepared their heart to ſeek God,</hi> though not legally purified, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 31. 19. and
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:115895:177"/> is highly diſpleas'd when the command, <hi>Do this,</hi> is Obſerved, but it is done unworthily, and therefore they ſay, he is pleaſed with <hi>benè,</hi> not meerly with <hi>bonum.</hi> The Ordinance it ſelf is the <hi>Index</hi> or Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone of unworthineſſe: Here is Chriſt offer'd and preſented to thee, and thou haſt no faith; Chriſt bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, bleeding for ſinne, and thou haſt no repentance; Chriſt for ſpiritual nouriſhment, and thou haſt no appetite. The Covenant is ſealed, and thou art no confederate, ſtrengthening and refreſhing grace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd, and thou art a dead man; Communion of Chriſts body and bloud, and thou art no member in Union with him: How unſatiable art thou to the Ordinance, and therefore eateſt and drinkeſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>4</label> This word [<hi>unworthily</hi>] may he taken two wayes, Privative and Contrary; Taken privatively, it is as much as not worthily, not ſuitably to the Nature and Uſe of the Ordinance; Taken contrarily, it is as much as wickedly, ſo we ſay, a man deals unworthily that is baſely, unjuſtly, injuriouſly.</p>
               <p>In the firſt ſenſe,</p>
               <p>He that hath no ſpiritual grace, and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not exerciſe it, or he that hath ſome, but doth not exerciſe it, may come unworthily, for the words, <hi>Take ye, eat ye,</hi> do denote, and ſo require the exerciſe and acting of our graces, ſuch as have no grace can exerciſe none, as a dead body without life cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe an act of life, it cannot take and eat. Hear what the Schoolman ſaith, <hi>Statum gratiae,</hi> &amp;c. that a ſtate of holineſſe and grace is neceſſary to the worthy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of this Sacrament; And I believe the ancient Fathers were of this ſenſe by the order of Baptiſm,
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:115895:177"/> the Sacrament of Regeneration going before the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per an Ordinance of corroboration, and this Rule ſpeaks plainly, no man unregenerate receives this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament worthily. It's a Doctrine of hard digeſtion, but hard wedges cleave hard knots, make that the point of your examination.</p>

The beſt ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers are ſooneſt drown'd; I would not cruſh the leaſt ſpark of grace, I mean by having grace, that ſpark in the flax, and by exerciſe the very ſmoak of that ſpark, Chriſt would not let them be drown'd, whom he cals <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>In the ſecond ſenſe taken contrary, unworthily is</p>
               <p>He that comes to this Table with a conſcience im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brued in guilt without remorſe, or lives in practice and cuſtom of foul ſins and luſts, we have ſuch as come out of the adulterous bed, newly ſtept off the ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bench; their hands are full of bribes and extortions, their mouths belch out lying, ſwearing and revenge, they come to the Sacrament in ſuperſtition to be ſhri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to ſin again, not in repentance to be forgiven, to go away and ſin no more, their proſaneneſſe dreams of a cure, not of a conQueſt, they are willing to leave their ſins upon Chriſts back, only while they go and
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:115895:178"/> fetch more; There is a wretched crew of ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants, that make conſcience of the Sacrament, and make no conſcience of thoſe ſins they live in. <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> came impudently, and in the purpoſe of horrible ſinne, <hi>Parta timeat qui paria audet,</hi> ſaith <hi>Novarine,</hi> Let them fear the like, that dare do the like; God was not pleaſed with them, that did <hi>eat the ſame ſpiritual meat, and drink the ſame ſpiritual drink,</hi> the Reaſon is given, <hi>they were idolaters, and committers of fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and other enormous ſinnes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. And who, you will ſay, can come without ſinne? I ſay, there are remaining ſinnes in the regenerate, but not reſerved ſinnes: If you hold the courſe and cuſtom of thoſe ſinnes, which your conſcience cannot but tell you of, you do but adde the ſinne of receiving unworthily to the reſt of your ſinnes, and blow up the fire of Gods wrath the hotter againſt you; why then (you ſay) bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtay away then come, to load our ſelves with more guilt? If you will not come, becaUſe you will not repent, and caſt off your ſinnes, you proclaim your juſt condemnation, in preferring your ſinnes before Chriſt Jeſus. If ye come without true repentance, <hi>you eat and drink your own damnation,</hi> nothing can lead you out of this labyrinth, but repentance and converſion: Therefore as the Prophet ſaid to ſome that deſired the day of the Lord, <hi>To what end is it for you? It's darkneſs and not light;</hi> ſo ſhall I ſay to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that are forward to ruſh into the Lords Table with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fear. To what end is it for you? The bread and wine ye eat and drink is but your own condemnation: Unto the wicked God ſaith, <hi>What haſt thou to do to</hi>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>2</label> There is a ſpeculative diſcerning of the Body of Chriſt, and there is a practical.</p>
                  <p>The ſpeculative diſcerning is the notion or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the ſignification of the outward elements.</p>
                  <p>That the Bread and Wine do repreſent Chriſts Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Bloud, That the Bread broken repreſents his Body broken <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is an eaſie piece of knowledge, as eaſie as to know that a picture or figure do repreſent ſuch a man, and there is no great meaſure of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to conſtrue all parts or rites of the Sacrament in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a true meaning.</p>
                  <p>In this ſenſe not to <hi>diſcern the Lords body</hi> is directly to inhere and ſtick in the bread and wine, as bread and wine, and to take the picture for the man: It may be there be ſome ſuch bruitiſh ignorants, that diſcorn not the meat from the diſh, nor the marrow from the bone, ſuch as theſe are, are fit to be excluded, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caUſe where there is no Analogy holden, there can be no Sacrament. The Analogy, I ſay, between the outward Sacrament, and inward thing, muſt either be known, or it is to us no Sacrament; For a ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, reſemblance, or Analogy, muſt be between two things at leaſt, and therefore thoſe that in a blinde and bruitiſh ignorance know nothing, but the outward part do not properly receive a Sacrament, but are like the carnal Jews that knew not the meaning of their Sacrifices, or of thoſe types of Chriſt which they had; The brazen Serpent was Chriſt, the Rock they drank of was Chriſt, but many of them dream'd not
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:115895:179"/> of him in the Uſe of them. I do not believe theſe <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> men of ſuch knowledge, were ſuch bruits, for the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 16. ſpeaks to them as wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who knew this, ſaying, <hi>The Bread we break, Is it not the Communion of the body of Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c.

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>3</label> The practical diſcerning of the Lords body is, when the body and bloud of Chriſt are ſo minded and intended, as to compoſe the inward man, and the outward behaviour of the Communicant into ſuch a poſture of ſpirit and carriage, as is ſuitable to Chriſts body and bloud there offered and exhibited unto faith, and the not diſcerning the Lords body, is when the behaviour is ſo looſe and rude, the inward man ſo diſcompoſed and carnal, as that interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, they may be ſaid not to minde, or not to <hi>diſcern the Lords body;</hi> So we would ſay of one whoſe car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage is wanton and looſe in the preſence of his fathers corpſe lying in preſence in a coffin or beer, you doe not minde, you conſider not who lies there, becaUſe if he did, another countenance and carriage would beſeem him, and ſo the <hi>Corinthians</hi> are taxed here for ſuch carriage of theirs, as proclaim'd they had no ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious thoughts, no ſad and fixed minde upon Chriſt bleeding and broken, for that conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would have beſpoken another frame of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and forme of behaviour. The reſult of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication is,</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle gives us a two-fold caUſe of
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:115895:180"/> eating and drinking unworthily.</p>
                  <p>1. If we underſtand not, know not the Analogy or reſemblance of the bread and wine to the body and bloud of Chriſt, but ſtick in the rind or ſhell, and feed only on the husks, as upon common bread and common wine, and reſting in that, as knowing not the Uſe or end, which makes the difference, which renders all bruitiſh ignorant people <hi>unworthy receivers,</hi> And how ſhould I make them know the danger that know not thus farre of the Uſe of this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance? Willingneſſe to be taught would help it, if they were not more willing to runne blindefold into the pit, than proudly unwilling to diſcover their filli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ignorance, and if they be unwilling, It's no cruelty but charity to keep a blinde man from running into a pit.</p>
                  <p>2. If we underſtand the meaning of the outward elements by rote or notional knowledge, but do not ſeriouſly and with a fixed intention conſider and look wiſhly upon Chriſts body and bloud repreſented, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, and to be exhibited to our faith, for this will compoſe our outward behaviour and inward ſpirit; this beſpeaks faith, repentance, affections ſuitable; this compoſes us unto reverence and ſerious behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our: Imagine the very Body of the Lord Jeſus was preſented to your eye, broken, bruiſed, bleeding for thy ſinnes under the ſtroke of Gods terrible juſtice, and ſo offer'd unto thee for thy ſalvation, Would not thy ſoul raiſe up all affections, and muſter up all it's forces, to receive him, to open to him, to thirſt after him, to admire and praiſe him? And doth not God in this Ordinance really hold him forth to thee as ſuch, and ſo to be received? The nature of the feaſt
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:115895:180"/> to which we are invited, teaches us how to dreſſe our ſelves; To a funeral we come in mourning, to a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage in a wedding-garment; The very minding of the body of Chriſt teaches men to come worthily, that is ſuitably, and the not minding of it with fixed intention is the caUſe that we come looſly, carnally, and ſo unworthily.</p>

And they that ſin wilfully after the knowledge of the truth, are ſaid <hi>to have trodden under foot the Sonne of God, and counted the bloud of the Covenant a common thing, and to have done deſpight to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of grace,</hi> Heb. 10. 19, 26. A meer Heathen is out of capacity of guiltineſſe of theſe high ſinnes; He is not guilty of the Body and Bloud of the Lord, which was never offer'd to him in this Sacrament. No ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravations of ſinne are like to the aggravations of the ſins of wicked Chriſtians, their guilt is not of ſo high complexion that never knew of Chriſt; either we muſt be ſaved, or we cannot be ſo eaſily damned, the weight of ſins againſt Chriſt is heavier than of thoſe that are meerly againſt the Law of God; We are the earth that drinks in the rain that cometh upon us; If we bear briars and thorns, we are nigh unto curſing,

                     <hi>whoſe end is to be burned,</hi> Heb. 6. 7, 8.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. How many do that, they think leaſt of, and are guilty of that, they once imagine not themſelves to be guilty of: but few of a thouſand will own this guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Body and Bloud of Chriſt, and yet as often as they do or have eaten and drunk at this Table unworthily, ſo often they have incurred and renew'd this guilt? Do not they ſay at the laſt day, <hi>When ſaw we thee an hungry or in priſon?</hi> Did the Jews think they pierced their true <hi>Meſsiah?</hi> There are not many Chriſtians in name and profeſſion ſuch, that can be convinced, that they hate and deſpiſe Chriſt as much as the very Jews that crucified him, which yet may be demonſtrate by clear arguments. The Jew honour'd the name of the <hi>Meſsiah,</hi> and expected great things of him, and yet hated and rejected him blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold; and ſo we call Chriſt Saviour and Lord, and beſprinkle him with ſweet water, but his reign and government over us, we utterly deſpiſe and hate, and prefer a ſordid luſt far before him.</p>

A ſtrange phraſe it is to <hi>eat and drink judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> but it is alluſive, and <hi>per mimeſin,</hi> as ſure as he eats of the Bread and drinks of the Cup unworthily, ſo ſure is judgement to follow thereupon, or to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company it, for he eats judgement, but it is to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, not to others, except they be partakers in his ſinne, which may be divers ways; So as we have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to inſert in all our prayers, Lord forgive our <hi>noſtra aliena,</hi> our other mens ſins, but without partnerſhip in the ſinne we need not fear ſhare in the judgement, He eats it to himſelf; and therefore that argument of the <hi>Donatiſt,</hi> which is riſe now a dayes, <hi>Si corruptis ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciaris,</hi> &amp;c.

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>2</label> How precious an Ordinance is this Supper, and yet how dangerous? There is life and death ſet before you It's on one ſide a refreſhing cloud, on the other a flaming fire; ſo by the ſame water and way were the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſaved, and the <hi>Aegypians</hi> attempting the like were drown'd: Thus Chriſt alſo is a precious ſtone to believers, a ſtumbling and a cruſhing ſtone to unbelievers, and the Word is a ſavour of life, and a ſavour of death; Some mens eyes are open'd by it, and ſome are ſhut; The ſame Ark is to <hi>Iſrael</hi> a glory, to the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> a ſcourge; Here is honey in the ſame roſe to the Bee, and poyſon to the Spider, and it is according as you eat and drink worthily or unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. We reade in Scripture, that when people cried to Chriſt for cure, uſually he put it upon their faith, <hi>According to your faith,</hi> and, <hi>If thou canst believe;</hi> and we never reade of any one that cried, that he was put by for want of faith; for if they gave never ſo little account, <hi>Lord, I believe, help my unbelief,</hi> it was accepted. The benefit of this Ordinance is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your Faith, Repentance, and if you can give but any account of them to God, you may
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:115895:183"/> drink Chriſt out of this Rock, but if you be in ſinnes of love and delight, and come in your wickedneſſe, you take the Sword by the point, not by the haft, and you ſhall ſmart for your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The horrible thunder of the Apoſtle in this place, is not to deterre, but to prepare Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants; An humble ſoul is affrighted with the terrour, and dare not draw nigh this fiery Mount, but it is not ſpoken to affright from the Sacrament, but to enforce a due preparation; When the deſtroying Angel rode his circuit, the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> lay ſecure within the line of bloud: This bloud here of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd will protect thee from this condemnation threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, if thou flie to it. But</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The ignorant that are without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and the ſcandalous without repentance, who are by the common vote of men excepted againſt, as unfit Communicants, they may know that this is a dreadfull eating and drinking, which is accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with ſuch a guiltineſſe, and wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It is not envy, malice, or partiality, but it is chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to entreat you not to luſt ſo eagerly after thoſe Quails, which while they are in your mouths, the wrath of God is like to fall upon you, both of you have marks enough of condemnation upon you; Deſire not to adde more, be ſure the King will ſurvey and view his gueſts, you cannot ſcape in the croud; What if you be taken from the Table, and caſt into utter darkneſſe? It concernes me to give you warning; If you take the Allarme, and

                  <p>Fourthly, The eating and drinking of the Lords Bread, and the Lords Cup unworthily, is a ſinne dangerous to Common-wealths and Churches, for it brings judgement, Epidemick judgement, ſo it did upon this Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>For this caUſe many among you are ſick and die:</hi> Haply they had ſome common and mortall ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or mortality, and knew not the caUſe of it. Happy we, if we knew the particular caUſe of Gods angry viſitations, ſinne in the generall we acknowledge, but we owne not our particular ſinnes; We have had many, and great, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon calamities, but are fallen from aſſigning them to the abUſe of the Sacrament, and yet we muſt confeſſe that what hath been a doore at which judgements have enter'd may be ſo againe: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, I think, that rationally I may excite pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Authority to reſtraine or to make proviſion of reſtraint for ſuch ſinnes as are pernicious to Commonwealths, in bringing forth publick judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which eat up and conſume the people, and ſuch is this ſinne, as I have ſhowne: I know no Powers can command or compell faith or ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving grace, but it's a ſure fallacy to inferre from thence, that he may not reſtraine ſinnes that bring publick judgements, or not bring the people to the means of faith. It's a ſaying, that a man
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:115895:184"/> cannot make his Horſe drinke without he will, but yet he may have him to the water. God directed the fourth Commandment to Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and Parents, and Maſters, and thereby ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuppoſed they had, or elſe gave them a Power or Commiſſion to ſee the Sabbath kept within their Juriſdictions, not I confeſſe to force the <hi>Ger Toſhab,</hi> or Proſelyte of the gate, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the whole Religion of the Jew, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſeven Commandments, as they call them, given to <hi>Noah,</hi> and not to violate the Sabbath: If he will live among them, he muſt Obſerve the Sabbath.</p>

<pb n="350" facs="tcp:115895:185"/> the Supper for a Thief or a Traitour, becaUſe that he was ſo, yet it was not viſibly and duly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved againſt him. Sinne is not ſcandalous, till it be knowne: If it be knowne to me, I muſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the office of a brother before I tell the Church: And if it was knowne to me, that a man was not regenerate, I durſt give him the Sacrament, yea I muſt, untill he be orderly convict of ſinne that may debarre him, for the Rule of Gods Word is beſt Reaſon, and that Rule eſtabliſhes an order, <hi>If he heare not the Church, let him be to thee a Heathen and a Publican,</hi> untill then, and upon my private knowledge, he is not to be a Heathen unto me.

So here, <hi>Let a man examine himſelf,</hi> that is, Let him prove in himſelf a diſpoſition of fitneſſe and meetneſſe, and ſo let him come, as a man that tries gold at the ſtone, he will not take it, becaUſe he tries it, for he findes it copper, but if it be indeed true gold; So one will not go abroad, becaUſe he hath beheld himſelf in the Looking-glaſſe, for he may finde deformity and filthineſſe, but becaUſe he hath corrected all inconcinnity by the glaſſe, and compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his dreſſe; And ſo except we will prevaricate the holy Ghoſt intends a fitneſſe and meetneſſe

                  <p>For the clearer opening of this point of ſelf-exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, I might thus diſtinguiſh, There is a ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>examination required of all men, of all Chriſtians, of all Communicants.</p>
                  <p>That which is required of all men, is, <hi>To ſearch and try their wayes</hi> in order to converſion or repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, <hi>Lam. 3. 40. Let us ſearch and try our ſelves, and turn unto the Lord,</hi> which if diligently done they might know and own their miſery, and finde an abſolute neceſſity of converſion, the want of this is the Reaſon that men lie ſo faſt aſleep in ſecurity, and purſue their beloved ſinnes without check or control, <hi>Jer. 8. 6. No man repented him of his wickedneſſe, ſaying, What have I done?</hi> Every one turned to his courſe, <hi>as the horſe ruſheth into the battel;</hi> And how is that? <hi>He mocks at fear, and is not affrighted, He ſaith among the Trumpets, Ha, ha,</hi> Job 39. 19, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It would take off their edge and metal; If men did but conſider and believe how directly their wayes point toward the eternal damnation of their ſouls. The Rule of this Examination, or the glaſſe which makes this reflexion is the ſevere Law of God which involves all ſinners under a curſe.</p>
                  <p>That which is required of all Chriſtians is to prove their own works, whether they be wrought in God, in order to their own comfort, <hi>Gal. 6. 4. Let every man prove his own work, and ſo ſhall he have rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing in himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> And this is the ſweet and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate reward of all ſincere duties, which leave a ſweet
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:115895:188"/> taſte, or ſavour behinde them, <hi>Heb. 11. 5. Enoch</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Tranſlation had this teſtimony that he pleaſed God: This is that reward, which God gives his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple before their tranſlation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as firſt-fruits before the harveſt, the unſpeakable comfort of a ſincere duty; Nor only his works, but a Chriſtian is to examine his ſpiritual eſtate, 2 <hi>Cor. 13. 5. Whether you be in the faith, Know ye not that Chriſt is in you,</hi> we ſhould not only be, but know we are, and this by examining, The Rule of which examination is the Goſpel, which gives marks and evidences of it.</p>
                  <p>That which is required of all Communicants is, to examine their fitneſſe and meetneſſe, which is their worthineſſe to come and eat at the Lords Table, and the Rule of this Examination is the Ordinance it ſelf, or the inſtitution of it, as I have before ſhew'd, for the graces to be exerciſed in it, and beſpoken by it, are the Rule by which we muſt examine our ſelves, whether we have them in us or no, and this ſelf-exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, this particular whereof the Sacrament it ſelf is the Rule, is that I have to inſiſt upon, and therefore I am not bound by the Law of the Text to flie ſo great a compaſſe, as to handle the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place of ſelf-examination in all his latitude, neither will I do it, but onely premiſe certain generall pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticall poſitions, whereby we may be either mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved unto, or directed in the performance of this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing duty, ſelf-examination, and they are theſe.</p>

                     </gap>, is one of the old wiſe ſentences, though interpreted by them the proud way, not as Religion teaches the humble way; Of all acquaintan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which you can have in this world, this is the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt acquaintance, and indeed the hardeſt to get, if we were not unwilling to get acquaintance with our ſelves, the Scripture need not Uſe ſo frequent exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations: How miſerable are they which purſue diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries, and amaſſe knowledge of almoſt every thing, and yet live and die ſtrangers to themſelves? One of the firſt works which the Word and Spirit works in men, is to give them a light to go down into the dark cellar of their hearts, and make diſcoveries; then a man begins to be amazed, and tremble at the fight of himſelf. It's ſaid of the loſt ſonne, <hi>Luke 15. that he came to himſelf;</hi> Self-knowledge is the School-miſtreſs of humility; We are proud, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caUſe we know not our ſelves; He that knows not himſelf muſt needs be proud; He that knows him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf loaths himſelf; He that knows his ſins, ſees neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Chriſt; He that knows his wants, prayes; He that knows his weakneſſe, fears and flies to the Rock; He that brings knowledge of himſelf to a Sermon, gathers out of the garden thoſe herbs that are medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinal to him; He that knows his own temptations, avoids the occaſions that Uſe to enſnare him; He that knows his own experiences, hopes with patience,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:115895:189"/> when he ſees no light: It's true, the heart is deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and who can know it? But we need not taſte all the water in the Sea to know it to be brackiſh, nor taſte every crab to know the tree; We know the earth well enough, though we never digg'd to the centre; no man is bound to number all his ſinnes or thoughts, God hath taught us, that all a natural mans imaginations are onely evil, continually evil; It's enough to know our ſelves judgingly, ſo farre as may occaſion us to know Chriſt ſavingly, whoſe riches are unſearchable, and cannot throughly be known, and perfectly.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, A man may be deceived in his ſpiritual eſtate all his life time, for want of ſelf-examination in a due manner, by a right Rule we are full of ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flattery, and of hypocriſie; we diſguiſe and extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate our ſinnes, we ſet a varniſh and good aſpect on our works and virtues; Before his converſion <hi>Paul</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note> thought himſelf alive, and that he was in the right, afterward he cals it, <hi>Confidence in the fleſh.</hi> After a <note place="margin">Phil. 3.</note> man comes into the opinion and profeſſion of Chriſt, he may be in the caſe of the Church of <hi>Laodicea, Thou ſayeſt I am rich, and knowest not that thou art naked;</hi> The <hi>Jew</hi> outwardly, thinks he is a <hi>Jew</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly; The fooliſh Virgins do not ſee but that they are wiſe. I know there is a Rule of certain diſcerning, but if we put not our ſelves into the ſcales, we may ſeem to our ſelves to be good weight when we are too light. I do not think that all hypocrites are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd to themſelves, which is the ſaddeſt miſtake that can be in the world, never to be convinced, till we hear that word, <hi>Depart, I know ye not;</hi> Not that I think that any ſincere heart, that is willing to come
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:115895:190"/> unto the light, and cries with the <hi>Pſalmist,</hi> Pſal. 139. 23. <hi>Search me, O Lord, and try me,</hi> doth ever periſh in this deceit, for ſuch a one hath Chriſt, and therefore hath life; and we are not ſaved, becaUſe we know we have him, but becaUſe we have him, Some are in Chriſt, but do not perfectly own it. It's a ſafe errour, but they that think they believe in him and do not, are not ſaved becaUſe they think they do, but damned becaUſe they do not, and this is a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous errour. The Lord put it into your hearts to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine your ſelves, and prove your ſelves, the onely way I know to get out of this flattering miſtake.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Men that live in the boſom of the Church, are by nothing more kept out of Chriſt, than the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that they have him already. They have a faith which keeps them from faith, and a believing that holds them faſt in unbelief. D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Whitakers</hi> approves that ſaying of <hi>Melancthon,</hi> That hiſtorical faith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely differs from juſtifying faith, and therefore (which I would have Obſerved) the <hi>Corinthians</hi> whom the Apoſtle exhorts to examine themſelves, <hi>Whether they were in the faith, whether Christ Jeſus was in them,</hi> were not Heathen <hi>Corinthians,</hi> but the Church, profeſſed Chriſtians already, and ſuch as had a faith of profeſſion, and then that Text will prove, that thoſe that have ſome faith may be in the Apoſtles ſenſe reprobates, becaUſe they are not in the faith. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns us all, that are profeſſed members of the Church as they were; <hi>Can faith ſave you,</hi> ſaith <hi>James,</hi> Chap. 2. meaning a ſuperficial, opinionative, inoperative faith? Alas he tels you of <hi>believing devils,</hi> that by confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all are damned; Let not this faith keep you from Chriſt, which doth not cloſe you with him, you
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:115895:190"/> may be a graff to the ſtock with a ſtring, but it will not knit and live, becaUſe it is not engraffed in: So you may be reputed Chriſtians and believers by an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward profeſſion and agglutination, by that faith you have, but never live ſpiritually or eternally by it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caUſe Chriſt Jeſus is not in you; All the terrour of the Lord draws no bloud; All invitations of the Goſpel move not, And why? BecaUſe you lie under the ſhell and ſhelter of this faith and believing, which defeats the operation both of Law and Goſpel, till God open your eyes to ſee thorow it, and bring you to ſee the need of a Chriſt accepting faith.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, There are but two ſpiritual eſtates, and all men while in this world muſt be in the one or other, not in both at once, and they are uſually known by the names of nature and grace, or as Scripture uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, <hi>darkneſſe and light, death or life;</hi> This is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious Rule, and brings this work of ſelf-examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into a narrow room upon this interrogatory, Art thou in the ſtate of unbelief and unregeneration, or tranſlated into the Kingdom of Chriſt Jeſus? Art thou in the narrow, or in the broad way? There is a great latitude, and many varieties and degrees of men in each of theſe, but from <hi>Rahab</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> from <hi>O ye of little faith,</hi> to <hi>O woman, great is thy faith,</hi> all are under the line of life, and ſo from the beſt flower in natures garden to the ſharpeſt thorn, all under the black line of death; The diſcovery is the ſooner made, becaUſe the partition is but into two, goats and ſheep, walking in two ſeveral wayes, to two ſeveral ends: You will ſay, Unto which of theſe will ye reckon them that are <hi>in tranſitu,</hi> as it were, in the birth, in the paſſage? I ſhould ſay, that as we reckon the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>break
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:115895:191"/> to the day, and the embryon of a man is rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon'd to humane kinde, and the contracted woman is called wife; ſo though I love not to diſtinguiſh of theſe moments, yet if any day-break of light, any ſeed of faith or good deſires, any little of Chriſt appear in any, I ſhould reckon them to the happier part the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, for they are ſmoaking flax, and bruiſed reeds under the ſweet promiſe of Chriſt, to be blown up, and to be ſtrengthened, and ſo would I have them comfortably in their ſelf-examinations to reckon themſelves: As likewiſe all men in the world may compendiouſly reckon themſelves under ſinne and wrath, and in ſtate of damnation, upon and by the argument, which is the convictive argument of the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Joh. 16. 9. All men are under ſinne</hi> that believe not in Chriſt, <hi>Of ſin, becaUſe they believe not in me,</hi> and it reaches all the world: Not believing in Chriſt proves every man under ſin, if not <hi>propter infidelitatem,</hi> for their unbelief, therefore <hi>Thomas</hi> and other Schoolmen deny it, as to them, that never heard of Chriſt, yet <hi>ratione infidelitatis</hi> by Reaſon of their not believing, <hi>The wrath of God abides upon them,</hi> as all confeſſe, and as the Scripture ſpeaks. Theſe four things may ſerve as motives to this duty of ſelf exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, and there are two more that rather look like directions therein.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, The Rule of this ſelf-examination muſt be (according to the properties of a Rule) a known and certain inflexible Rule, that is not partial to or againſt us; for how ſhall we proceed from examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our ſelves to judge our ſelves, <hi>verſ.</hi> 31. if the proceſſe be not regulated, ſo as the judgement may be true and certain; therefore the word of God muſt be
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:115895:191"/> that Canon or meaſure, by which, if we will not be deceived, we muſt be tried, for that muſt judge us another day; by a falſe ſtandard, or a falſe touchſtone, or falſe rule we diſcern nothing; and therefore when thou goeſt about this work, baniſh all thy own flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Reaſons, all other mens fooliſh and fraudulent comforts and counſels; Let the Word of God ſit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee, and ſtand or fall before that Tribunal; Seeſt thou not how the Phariſee flatter'd himſelf, judging himſelf by his own traditional exerciſes? The young man flatter'd himſelf, <hi>All this have I done; Paul</hi> ſhows upon what confidences he flatter'd himſelf, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed every man will be in good eſtate, if he may judge by his own fancy, flattery or conceit, but falſe <hi>medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums</hi> beget but fallacies in concluſion, and our ſouls are betray'd and undone by Lesbian rules, a ſincere heart will not ſtand to that teſt, knowing that fleſh and bloud may ſpeak good to me, as the falſe Prophets to <hi>Ahab,</hi> and the word of God ſpeak evil, as <hi>Michaiah</hi> did unto him; God is not pleaſed that any man ſhould bear falſe witneſſe againſt, or for himſelf; We may neither proudly and partially acquit our ſelves upon falſe and flattering perſwaſions, nor on the other hand deny the leaſt evidence of grace, and of the Spirit in our ſelves, wherein the godly do often deſerve blame by ſlighting and undervaluing the work of grace in their hearts; There are proud ſelf complaints as well as ſelf flatteries; The Word is the moſt impartial Judge of our ſtate, or of our actions.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, It's neceſſary to ſtick upon the work of ſelf-examination, untill we bring it to an iſſue, and be able to make a judgement upon our own ſelves, for we are apt to pull off the plaiſter, when it begins to
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:115895:192"/> ſmart before it hath done its work, and are unwilling to ſet up all our Reaſonings, and bring them to a <hi>non plus,</hi> and ſo we never know our ſelves, never judge our ſelves; ſometimes a man is Sermon-ſhaken, and his heart begins to tremble, and to Queſtion with it ſelf, and if he would but follow the ſtroke he might come to finde out his condition, but he lets the iron cool again, and like <hi>Felix</hi> when he trembled, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes <hi>Paul</hi> till another time; This the Apoſtle ſhews us in theſe words, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 24. he goes away from the <hi>glaſse, and ſtraightway forgets what manner of man he was,</hi> and therefore he ſaith, we muſt look into the glaſſe, and continue therein, reſolving to be deaf to fleſh and bloud, friends, carnal counſels, and by the Rule of the Word to bring the Queſtion to an iſſue, whether <hi>pro</hi> or <hi>con,</hi> for us, or againſt as.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>4</label> I have laid down theſe ſix Rules, which are of good Uſe, and great ſervice in the examination of our ſelves at all times, or at any time. Now I come to the particular buſineſſe of the Text, which is ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>examination in order to our worthy coming to the Lords Table, for that's the work which lies before us; And for your better inſtruction, I ſhall draw down your thoughts in order to the point, by certain conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Rule of this ſelf-examination is the very Ordinance according to Chriſts Inſtitution hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore recited; You ſee the Apoſtle doth not particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly number or rehearſe what the graces,
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:115895:192"/> or what the requiſites are upon which interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatories the examination muſt be made; He ſaith not, Let a man examine himſelf of this, and of that, but <hi>Let a man examine himſelf;</hi> The Reaſon is that which I learn from <hi>Chemnitius,</hi> That if the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Chem.</hi> exam. de Euchar.</note> be the Rule by which the examination is to be made, then it will follow, that what ſuch a repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of Chriſts death and ſufferings, and ſuch a demonſtration of Gods offended Juſtice, as is here made, what ſuch an offer and exhibition of Chriſt his body and bloud unto us, for communion thereof, doth beſpeak and require of us; That frame of ſpirit, thoſe affections, thoſe graces are requiſite unto the Communicant, which what they are hath been alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy deduced from the nature of the Ordinance it ſelf, and by me declared.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They being known what they are, it follows that a man examine himſelf, whether they be in us, for elſe we cannot come ſuitably to the Ordinance, nor take and eat the body and bloud offer'd to us, the effect and fruit of ſelf-examination being to know our own ſelves, 2 <hi>Cor. 13. 5. Whether Christ be in us, Whether we be in the faith;</hi> To know what graces are required, is no point of ſelf-examination, but whether we be in ſome meaſure furniſht with them or no, and by the duty enjoyn'd it is eaſily inferr'd, That a man may know whether he have thoſe graces, for elſe all examination was unprofitable and vain, and known they are by reflexion and inſight into our ſelves, as a man knows his thoughts, his own purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, his meaning, and can tell them to another being asked; ſo we may know the graces and workings of the Spirit in our hearts, <hi>Qui credit fidem ſuam videt in</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Auſtin. <hi>de trin.</hi> l. 13. c. 1.</note>
                     <pb n="366" facs="tcp:115895:193"/> 
                     <hi>corde ſuo,</hi> ſaith <hi>Auſtin,</hi> that is, except ſuch a dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ſmoak be within, that they appear not, as ſometimes clouds ariſe and cover the face of the Sun, but that is not for want of an eye, but for want of clearneſſe in the object, and then if there be a vapour upon the glaſſe, it makes no reflexion; And there is great Reaſon that a man ſhould not only have the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces required, but ſhould by ſelf-examination know that he hath them, becaUſe otherwiſe he might blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, and at all adventures ruſh upon the Ordinance, and eat and drink damnation to himſelf.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. BecaUſe a man can only then be ſaid to know he hath the graces required, when he doth diſcern and diſtinguiſh them from all counterfeits or ſemblan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that are like, therefore is ſelf-examination neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; For as gold hath copper, a counterfeit of it ſelf: ſo have all true graces ſome thing like themſelves, and called by their name, which are not right, but ſome ſlighty ore lying nearer day; As there is a faith called which is not faith, a repentance not repentance, a love of God which is not the love of God, a ſorrow for ſinne which is not godly ſorrow, there is meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, not a grace, but a moral vertue, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And therefore examination of our ſelves is both neceſſary and difficult, that we take not <hi>Leah</hi> for <hi>Rachel,</hi> and ſo come to the Lords Table to no more purpoſe than he that goes to the market with a braſſe ſhilling, which he thinks to be good money.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Then we have this priviledge, <hi>And ſo let him eat of this bread,</hi> &amp;c. When we by examination finde that we have, though but a ſeed or ſpawne of thoſe right and genuine graces which are differenced and diſtinguiſht from all ſemblances and counterfeits
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:115895:193"/> which are called by the ſame name; If every faith confeſſing Chriſt were ſaving; If every <hi>nollem factum,</hi> I am ſorry, were true repentance; If every mans ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>dolet,</hi> it grieves me, were godly ſorrow, there are few or none that could be called unworthy, but there is a difference that makes diſtinction between ſemblance and truth, which few do finde in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, becaUſe they reſt in generals and equivocals. I have in a Sermon upon this point formerly given the Characters of true grace, and need not ſay it over again at this time. Let every man examine the truth of his graces by theſe Characters, and ſo make Uſe of this priviledge, <hi>Let him eat</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And if I might give you the <hi>Iliads</hi> in a nut-ſhell, theſe are the differences and the characters.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>5</label> The Difference between Nature and Grace is,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Nature begins all his actions from, and refers all unto ſelf, pride, profit, pleaſure, glory, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon honeſty of men to men; Grace hath this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, it turns the face of, and ſets a by as on the heart, whereby it intends, aims to ſeek to pleaſe, to know God, and therefore diſcovers that we ſaw not, that emptineſſe of, and enmity to God which is in us; In a word, it ſets up Gods intereſt above ſelf, which nature cannot do.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Between knowledge and knowledge. There is a ſpecial knowledge of God and of the Word, which is large and beautifull, but the character of true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is affection, as the light that's joyn'd with heat

                  <p n="3">3. Between faith and faith. There is a Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing, a Chriſt acknowledging faith, <hi>Alii cogitant pij credunt,</hi> ſaith <hi>Austin,</hi> but the character of true faith is, That it accepts of, and cloſes with Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, both as a Lord and Saviour, and that upon Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terms, to deny ſelf, and take up his Croſs, and be his, and this faith is inſeparable from holineſſe, or a godly life, never to be found in a wicked or unregenerate man.</p>

There is a Repentance like that of <hi>Judas,</hi> full of anguiſh, a tormenting anguiſh of ſpirit; But the character of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance unto ſalvation, is the riſe of it from godly ſorrow, which feels love, the nature of it is a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to ſinne no more, but to cleave to God, the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of it is fruit unto holineſſe; Conviction, contrition, converſion, make it perfect.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Between Love and Love. There is a love of God ariſing from ſelf-love, ſo one Publican loves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, as a Benefactour: But the character of true love is, that it riſes from ſenſe of his firſt and ſaving love to us loſt ſinners, and carries us on to deſire him, to delight in him, to have fellowſhip, to be in friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with him, and to be like him.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Between Deſire and Deſire. There is a deſire of ſalvation to be out of hell, a deſire of grace meerly as a ſign and ſecurity for heaven to eaſe our painfull an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh; But the character of true deſire is ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as well as ſalvation, grace, not meerly for a bridge to heaven, but for Union, Communion and Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity with, and unto Chriſt Jeſus.</p>

                  <p>I will proceed no further, this is a taſte of what I before delivered; Theſe are the graces of a Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicant; Theſe are their Differences and Characters; Theſe lead you on to the priviledge granted, <hi>And ſo let him come and eat,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Great Uſe may be made of this point, and the Uſe is rather to be made by you than me, for ſo the Text, <hi>Let a man examine himſelf,</hi> but I will point you to it in a word or two.</p>

I have ſaid enough, to move you, enough to direct you, the benefit is great, the danger great, the means to obtain the benefit to eſcape the danger is this; If you finde ſinne labour to bring repentance; If you need a Saviour, come and take him as freſhly bleeding, but bring thirſt and faith with you; Have an eye to the Serpent on a pole, reſt your ſouls as the Dove did upon this Ark, a crucified Chriſt; but do not deceive your ſouls, by a ſlight performance; Call your lives and wayes to the bar; Examine, judge your ſelves; Do not neglect, becaUſe no body ſees you, there is a God will ſearch out your ſinne, and judge alſo; You have great imployments, make opportunity, you are in ſuits, one Ordinance of God doth not diſable another, you may lawfully pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue your right, and yet purſue peace, and keep chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; If you ſuffer wrong, forgive, it's glorious; If you do wrong, <hi>Leave your gift at the Altar, and be reconciled firſt,</hi> that's more glorious; Set apart time, ſet apart your ſelves, Commune with your heart in
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:115895:195"/> your cloſet in ſilence, no man caſts up his accounts in a croud or throng, you need no other buſineſſe while you do this; Seek of God by prayer and faſting a ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearching heart, and do it as if ye were to die; make the accounts between God and your ſouls even, and ſeQueſter your ſelves to that purpoſe; for ſo when you caſt up your accounts, you Uſe to ſhut up your ſhops.</p>
                  <p>2. That Donatiſtical principle of ſeparation from Congregations or Churches, wherein there is a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of worthy and unworthy, doth from hence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſome check; for a man is to examine himſelf concerning his fitneſſe, and if he eats unworthily he eats damnation or judgement to himſelf, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a private member hath here no call or warrant to examine the fitneſſe of others, nor do they that are unworthy eat judgement to him, but to themſelves; But of this I have already ſpoken at large.</p>

                     <pb n="371" facs="tcp:115895:195"/>1. I do not enforce it upon this Text, which doth not intend an Examination meerly by propounding Queſtions, but a finding out of our ſpiritual eſtate, and of that whole fitneſſe and meetneſſe required of us in order to our acceſſe to the Lords Table; That in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion was an exploration by Queſtion, touching know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, competent or ſufficient; This in the Text is required before every Sacrament, that but once in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to firſt Admiſſion, and therefore as I prove it not by this Text, ſo I muſt needs ſay, it is not diſproved by it; And therefore they that infer from hence againſt all Examination by others, muſt neceſſarily deſtroy all catechizing, whether by parents, maſters or others, which cannot be; Every man is bound to examine himſelf, but not bound from examining others that are under his charge, for then he ſhould be bound from his duty, and therefore it holds not negatively, that no man may examine another, and ſo both parts may let this Text reſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Church of Chriſt did never hold her ſelf unconcerned in the admittance of members into her ſociety. In the primitive Churches; when men of years came in unto the Church from Idolatry and Heatheniſm, they paſſed a ſevere teſt, and were cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chized a long time before they became competents for Baptiſm, and at their Baptiſm had Queſtions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, and by them anſwer'd, as touching their faith and purpoſe of life, and having paſt the teſt, then it was needleſſe at the Supper, except they fell into groſſe ſin, but that caſe and ours is different, when all are baptized in infancy, and therefore muſt be cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chized and inſtructed in the fundamentals of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and have the teſt of the Church before they
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:115895:196"/> come to the Lords Table, or elſe never.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Therefore in all Goſpel Churches, we may find footſteps of this exploration, look into the <hi>Romiſh</hi> and Popiſh way, they have auricular Conceſſion, which is a mixture of tyranny and ſuperſtition, but the people muſt paſs this teſt, which did not they ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantly take for an eaſie way of pardon of ſin, they would be ſenſible of as extream ſlavery; and it's <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raeus</hi> his Obſervation, That this Confeſſion was of old inſtituted <hi>ad hanc probationem,</hi> for this trial or probati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mens fitneſs to this Sacrament. The <hi>Lutherans</hi> have ſuch a way of Examination and Confeſſion too, as <hi>Chemnitius</hi> confeſſes; And the <hi>Augustan</hi> Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> notes, is plain for it, <hi>Nulli admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuntur niſi prius explerati;</hi> And ſo in <hi>England</hi> it was ordered, <hi>That no man ſhould be admitted that had not learnt his Catechiſm,</hi> &amp;c. I do not bring theſe inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to any end, but to cry down the ignorant opinion of novelty and ſtrangeneſs; For if we in <hi>England</hi> had followed our own Rule, it had not been ſuch a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger as it now ſeems,</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The intent and end of this Examination in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion was, partly that thereby the Church might know her own members, and their due qualifications, partly that there might be a help to prepare, and put into the way ſuch as could not examine themſelves; For if the Church ſhould afford her Communion to all at all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures, to what ſcandal and contempt ſhould ſhe proſtitute her ſelf and the Ordinance, there would be no wiſdom in making her Communion like that of a common Inn, where known and unknown are all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like; Nor would there be charity to ſuffer blind folks to run into an open pit, and ruſh on the ſword-point;
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:115895:196"/> You may Obſerve how willingly a patient will anſwer a Phyſician Queſtioning him about his bodily eſtate; And a clyent his counſellour Queſtioning him about his title or caUſe, becaUſe both are in order to adviſe, and help of them that cannot help themſelves, and ſuch is this, if it were ſo well interpreted; but miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation and prejudice judges otherwiſe, for men look upon it as a dominion over their faith, not a help to their weakneſs, eſpecially if they ſee a diſtance kept, and authority aſſumed; They look upon it as an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignment, and take themſelves to come to a Bar or Tribunal to be examined upon delinquency, which kinde of diſtances I like not in ſuch a buſineſs as tends to ſociety and communion, where poor and rich <hi>are all one in Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> And if any man through miſtake have conceived, That this doth but ſet up a Tribunal upon him, to dive into his bReaſt, to extort his ſecrets like an auricular conceſſion, I blame him not of his backwardneſs to appear, for ſo ſhould I, for I abhor both that tyranny, and that ſuperſtition, but if no more be but that the Church would know my faith or help my ignorance, I ſee not but I may conclude with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

<pb n="374" facs="tcp:115895:197"/> for this in the New Teſtament: I anſwer, That 'tis a point of order, not of faith; <hi>It's of profitable Uſe,</hi> ſaith <hi>Hooker, not of abſolute neceſsity, for then I muſt be examin'd too, and it would extend to all the world, as well as us, and yet you exact it not at Miniſters hands, nor men of known ſufficiency, Therefore it's not of abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsity, but of order, I mean not of neceſsity to worthy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. In ſome caſes profitable; and I muſt tell you we were in a ſingular and particular caſe here in <hi>England;</hi> for you know men and women had been by Law com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd to receive the Sacrament ſo oft in a year, which compulſion, to diſcover Recuſancy, with the neglect of catechizing, brought in a world of people blinde and unworthy, the Remedy and Reformation of which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate abUſe, and the prevention of Separation from our Churches (had no order been appointed) which muſt have univerſally followed by the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the thing, and inſtigation of them that lay on the advantage, were ſuch Reaſons as could enforce no leſſe; Nor do I know how poſſibly otherwiſe the matter could be remedied or radreſt, not intended to deſpiſe any that had right before, and had been long admitted.</p>
                  <p>3. The principal thing is, that the end of this Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination be obtained, though the form or manner be not punctual, as namely, That a man have competent knowledge of this Ordinance, and be ſo known to have, whether by good teſtimony of others that are able, or by our acquaintance, or by conference, or he is a learned man, a knowing man, a Miniſter of the Word, which may be juſtly preſumed to have due knowledge, as <hi>Paul</hi> preſumed that <hi>Agrippa believed
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:115895:197"/> the Prophets.</hi> I ſay in theſe caſes, the end of Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is attained: Nay, if one ſhould come and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare himſelf by confeſſion of his Chriſtian faith, and purpoſe of life without any Queſtion propounded or asked, I ſhould not ſo dote upon Queſtions and forms of Examination, as not to paſſe ſuch a one for a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man, becaUſe I have attained the end of all Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, which is, I know, that he hath knowledge competent, not that I would encourage any man to break a wholſom order, or eſtabliſhment; for the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture requires, and the Apoſtle enjoyned to <hi>ſee order in the Church,</hi> Col. 2. 5. But that I would principally intend the thing it ſelf above the form, not denying the right which he hath by his knowledge and profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, nor thruſting him upon a ſeparation meerly upon a form, except in one caſe, that a man intend to break a publick order, and to deſtroy it by his example; As if a man tear my hedge upon a juſt occaſion, I take no offence, but if he purpoſe to let all the Swine into my corn, I ſhould oppoſe him.</p>
                  <p>4. I could wiſh that all Examination were bounded and limited to ſuch Queſtions as are of neceſſity to this Sacrament; There were printed ſome few Queſtions and Anſwers, as the rule and bounds of it ſome five or ſix years ſince; For I dare not truſt the diſcretion of all men without a gage; And if any man ſhould ask me ſuch a Queſtion as is not neceſſary, or for a Scholar to know, or to pry into my ſecrets, I ſhould, though I could anſwer, crave excUſe. I am afraid of, and terribly hate auricular confeſſion, I love no ſtep toward it, and therefore I would not anſwer upon my own liberty.</p>
                  <p>5. Though ſome will ſay, I can declare my ſelf to
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:115895:198"/> my Miniſter, but not otherwiſe. I confeſs the Paſtour hath the greateſt account to make of his people, and is moſt concerned: But what if the Church will not truſt him with that report, as all Miniſters are not to be truſted with it, ſuch is their looſneſſe in this point, and too much facility? And were I to chUſe, I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do it under the eye of witneſſes, eſpecially in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with women, who though in one regard, their modeſty hinders to ſpeak before others, yet in other regards is matter of occaſion to them that are ill mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which muſt needs be avoided, providing things honeſt, not before God but men.</p>
                  <p>6. Laſtly, Let men lay conſcience to the point, and ſet by paſſion and prejudice, both examiner and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, and in humility and meeknes deny themſelves, to keep up ſome face of order in theſe broken times; Let your thirſt to this Sacrament carry you thorow a thorn-hedge, and I on the other hand ſhall ſtoop low, rather than a thirſty ſoul ſhould want the Sacrament, or be thruſt on the Rock of Separation, and ſo we ſhall meet at the end, though differ in the way. It ſhould be a very ſorry anſwer indeed, that I would not make the beſt of, and (I hope) you would not make the worſt of any errour or infirmity in me, I know Order in an Army (as he ſayes) kils no body, yet without it they are a Rout, and not an Army.</p>
